See those people there? They look after me
This is a photograph of who I might be
Man in a uniform, bride on his arm
#
Got out the grave and walked away
How am I planning to talk today
Putting the game on lock today
And listen to what I am telling you (What?)
Bones be switching it up, I did
Bones be fucking it up, I give
You cannot beat him, boy, I am the only one
You are the lesser man, I am the chosen one (What?)
Flicking off the ash, I'm a figment of the past
When I pass, all I ask is to put my body in the trash
Came from the muddy (Woo), I'm forever nothing (Woo)
Beautiful night sky, I'm rolling up some ugly (SESH)
I could fit your house inside my house like five times
I give him four shots now that pussy got five lives
I'm live wire (Live),from the place where the time dies
The clock don't tick and the humans don't lie (Lie)

I'ma get it how I get it
I'ma move how I move
I'ma get it how I get it
I'ma slide when I'm ready
I'ma get it how I get it
I'ma move how I move
I'ma get it how I get it (How I get it)

Fuck whatever you got to say
I'm sipping and dipping, enjoying my day
Suckers hate 'cause they ain't in my lane
You broke and you hate it, go fall into place (Who?)
Who? Bitch, get the fuck out my face
I'll get it and spend it up all in a day
Penthouse where I'm making the plays
Spent a clean hundred thousand on Js (Who?)
Six cars, bitch, all of 'em paid
Rude Dog, nigga all in the way
.350 blow 'em out of the way
Bag 'em and tag 'em, I'm not here to play (Who?)
Head first, nigga, I do not wait
Clean cut, runnin' straight to the cake
Merch sales going up by the day
Suckers mad I won't show 'em the way (Who?)
Get it by yourself, like I did, bitch
I won't ever try to help, I hope you flop, bitch (Flop, nigga)
This weed I be smoking smell like skunk shit (Skunk)
HollowSESH will get you killed in that mosh pit, you bitch (Who?)

Who, nigga? Who

When I'm alone, safe and sound
When I'm around you
I can feel you're disappointed in me
I know you're all burnt out
Just forgive me once more
Don't turn the lights out
I wanna see you and I wanna feel you there

I watched the light, it turned my eyes to grey and ashes
I watched the light, it turned my eyes to grey and ashen

Waiting
Always waiting for you
#
Switchblade on my left and my right side
I don't wanna go back to my old ways
Switchblade on my left and my right side
I don't wanna go back to that
Now I'm drowning in the pain
Yes, I know you, but you don't know me
I got it, you know you don't
I'm done with living to fall apart
Dreams die slowly
To hell with the old me
Dreams die slowly
To hell with the old me, ayy

Live alone, die alone
Motherfucker, I know the game
Live alone, die alone
Any second, I'll be gone, ay
Live alone, die alone
Motherfucker, I know the gamе
Live alone, die alonе
Live alone, die alone
Dreams die slowly
To hell with the old me
Dreams die slowly
To hell with the old me

You got money on your left
You got hoes on your right
You can throw it all in one night
But you'll never get a goodbye
From those who really know you well
You gon' be alone
Ayy, late night, back seat
Curtains drawn, lights out
Cold cut, hot blood
Weapon on me right now
I just wanna go home, I don't wanna go out
I'ma stay in while the rest just show out

Switchblade on my left and my right side
Switchblade on my left and my right side
#
Forever ever living far away
I want to leave but I know we can't
I cannot picture myself going on
Sitting alone in a house with no lights on
Wanna write down all my shit that you never on
You say I'm heartless, baby, you never wrong
Lying awake in the dark
It's not so bad whenever I'm with you
(Lying awake in the dark)
#
Hey, hey
Give me the pack, no time to weigh it up (weigh it up)
Bringing it back now watch me wake 'em up (Wake 'em up)
See me around, they like "there he go" (there he go)
Putting it down by your stereo (stereo)
Downtown
I get my fix and then I bounce out
I hit the switch and make 'em bow down
He just a bitch and he ain't bout what I'm bout

Ay
Put it on and Imma take it home
My body feeling like a vacant home
Nobody wanna come help me, they rather burn me down (Down)
Look at my mind, it's pandemonium
Look at the time, say I don't know ya'
I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back

(SESH)
I know my time ain't running out, it make me dangerous
No don't ask, get no pass, you can't hang with us
In the past, I was cashed, I ain't changed a bit
Think of Bones, when she dream, she pray to me
Walking on thin ice, I think I'm about to fall through (Yeah)
Remember all them nights I pulled you close and told you
I won't be around
I won't always hold you down

My neck Illuminated
And the hooptie candy painted
Made me a little bit of change
But I never thought of changing
I don't feel right
The woods don't peel right
'Bout to lose my head
Run straight in a field like
#
You say you love me but you're never around
Now I know how it feels to have nothing left
I know you'd rather be lost than found
I remember every word that you ever said
So hold on, you never say it back, but
Now I'm sitting here wondering why you left
I know your mind like the back of my hand
Erase the time, retrace the lines
Whenever we were 'round town that night
You said you'd run away with me
Except you ran in the other direction
#
I was chipping
I be tripping
Pimpin', kicking it in the back seat
Limpin' like a pigeon
I be sipping up like a flask piece
I don't got no phone number
Baby, no, don't ask me
I don't want your hoe, brother, I'm too busy ashin'
Young, white, and trashy
Your bitch tryna catch me
Earnhardt, you in the race but you gon' end up crashing
Ambulance is flashing
Wave the checkered flag, please
Then he try to take my spot but can't nobody pass me

Ain't a motherfucker finna test me
When I pull it out, bitch you go bye-bye
So long, auf wiedersehen, see you in thе next life
Your bitch, she watching mе
Hoes seem to be jocking me
But it's ok
I'm good under pressure no time for no lecture
But ain't no one stopping me
Bitch wait a minute, I got these windows they tinted
No, no, no, no, you can't see inside of it
She want me inside of it
I'm barely living but bitch I'm minding my business
No, no, no, no
I cannot confide for you
Pussy I looked out for you, aye
Did it on my lonesome
Check, go and roll some
El, let me hold some
Quarter ticket, cash on me
Hit you like you stole some
Never tell me hold on
I can't wait for nobody
Time waits for no one

Pop the trunk, let it out
Iced out like Fedorov
Used to smoke that shit that leave the whip smelling like ethanol
Team at my beck and call
'Cause I'd do the same, bitch
Someone in my circle need some shit then I arrange it
Banging all my new shit
I can do no wrong, boy
No matter the price, no I will not do no song, boy
Diamonds in the bezel
Pedal to the metal
None of my bitches like rappers
All they slap is black metal

I do this shit so easily
Like ABCDEFG
She fall asleep and dream of me
Don't step to me
I keep that heat
I keep a piece
Don't reach for me
You will lose a limb, bitch
Gold chains, platinum beeper, bleach white pimp, bitch
#
Hopping out the back, I don't know the day
Forty on my mind, .40 on my waist
Jump in front the line, no time to waste
I do not need your love, I just need my space
Hopping out the back, I don't know the day
Forty on my mind, .40 on my waist
Jump in front the line, no time to waste
I do not need your love, I just need my space

Jump in the back, roll in the front
Every day coming, I do what I want
I do not want you to do what I've done
All that I know is it's you that I want
Don't get me bad, don't give me none
I will not stop until I am the one
I do not play with these bitches and thankfully
You know it's true, baby, that's why you wait for me

Hoppin' out the back, I keep that forty on me
Rolling out the pack, I got that three cig on me, on me (Aye)
Hoppin' out the back, I keep that forty on me
Rolling out the pack, I got that three cig on mе, on me
Ain't nobody gonna tell me nothin'
Riding in thе back I don't feel nothing
No

Hopping out the back, I don't know the day
Forty on my mind, .40 on my waist
Jump in front the line, no time to waste
I do not need your love, I just need my space
#
If I let you go, I know I'd never be the same again
I would be waiting around for nothing
When you tell me everything is fine, I start to breathe again
You're the only one that ever made me feel something

Stumbling down the road with the lies in my head
Walking through the cold with the wind at my back
It's been a long, long time
It's been a long, long time
It's been a long, long time
It's been a long, long time, time, time, time

Back in action
I get it cracking like I'm supposed to
Hate to say it, fuck it, I love it, bitch, I told you
You had your doubts, okay
Well, bitch, I had my own too
Got it out the mud, yeah, I did it on my own too
Diamonds on my chain but I feel no different
Got you by my side, I feel no difference
I think it's time that I get in my zone
Bringing it home
Fuck with the team and I'm gripping the chrome
Fuck do you want? Fuck is you on?
I get it popping at three in the morn'
I know things have changed up
I know that they blame us
I do it 'cause this what I do
You do this shit 'cause you wanna be famous, yeah

Stumbling down the road with the lies in my head

Airblade

Backed in, get back
Insane, pack out
Packin', get actin', get packed out
Back down, pass out
Bones be blacked out
Snuck my snub nose, pass the pack down
Before I act out, I need the dope
Before I lash out, I need to know
Picking up my pistol, flip a riddle
Then i'm ready
Blow

Riding in the motherfucking drop top
Chevy, Imma pedal to the metal
I'ma go like Petty
.45 with a .50
Big trunk got me heavy
Two shots, now he on the stairway to heaven
Pop pop, buck shot
Bitch shut the fuck up
If you live to tell, bitch you done lucked up
I'm the living hell and I know that's fuckеd up
Brain in a cell, if they call, I'm locked up
Bad to thе bone, bone
Heart made of chrome, chrome
Ice in the chain got my blood running cold, cold
Looking at my catalog
Face on my lone, lone
Looking at the world like it's all your fault, fault
Hundred K flow, put em up in a vault
Nobody know what SESH be about
Only thing right with the world is us
No pass, just puff on the O's in my lungs

HealthySESH

Big ass blunt, light it up while I'm swerving
Dirty ass mouth, wash my words down with bourbon
Bitch I don't rap, every verse is a sermon
My shooters some niggas that be burning down churches
Swear you all tough but we know you just actin
All I get is Big Love, bitch, I'm Bill Paxton
Luger or the .40 Glock, still not lacking
Left him all bloody then I threw his ass a napkin
Mess with my reality, yeah I'm fully focused bitch
Stuntin round town, getting knowledge from my older chick
All up on my dick, cause it's longer than a ruler is
I didn't go to college I was hanging with the hooligans
Give no fucks, niggas know we made it cool again
Ice around my neck, colder than a cooler is
Lock up in the spot with the gang, like a blizzard hit
Fuck the industry, I ain't trynna be censored bitch
Built fast, life, thank god that I'm living it
Two girls with me I feel like John Ritter did
Fucking on swell I don't know where the sitter is
I'm not well I'm a menace like Dennis is
Real start bitch, light a blunt, then I go to rock
Every song hit, like a bomb dropped in Iraq
I don't follow rules, bitch I do what I fucking want
All around the globe and it won't never ever stop
#
It's been a year since I heard your voice
It's crystal clear you have made your choice
And I wonder if you think about me
The way that I do you
My thoughts are sober
The party's over
I'm seeing my way out
You took me for granted
You left me stranded
With nobody to turn to
You said that I'd be fine
You threw me in the fire
And I got burnt
I'm walking on a line
I'm barely holding on
I barely feel alive
When there was nobody there for you
Tell me I cared for you
I was the only one
#
My dear friend, tell me what has happened to you
My dear friend, tell me what has happened to you

I just want to know when you gotta go
Don't be embarrassed, nothing is set in stone
Everything you feel is normal
Jumping off the balcony, I hope I land right
Jumping off the balcony, I hope I land
I don't know if you got my letter
I don't know if I'm getting any back
I don't know if you got my letter
I don't know if I'm getting any back
#
When you're not around
I can feel your absence lingering
When you're not in town
I can feel the weather changing ever so slowly
Things always change, but my blunt, it never did
I just roll one, two, three, four, five
I get back to you
Living is impractical
Know this feeling's natural
But I don't wanna wait
I just hope that it happens to you

I just keep it, keep it moving on, on
I just keep it, keep it moving on, on
I just keep it, keep it moving on, on
I just keep it, keep it moving on, on
Wait, wait, wait

Gone with the wind, I'm moving
Going all alone, I'm choosing
Gone with the wind, I'm moving
But forever losing, losing

Ayy, I don't wanna do that
Glock with a new tec
I don't wanna show that side of me
When I take a look back
You would never shoot back
Didn't matter you was gonna side with me
Rolling through your town
That Bones, they banging loud
I know I should be proud of me
But I don't feel no diffеrence
I figure what I was missing
I took what I was givеn
And I gave it to the birds
Watch em fly, fly away

But I was going to love you
I ain't trynna come fuck with you
I just really hope you know that I-

I keep the weapon on my dick say for your bitch, that's a fact
Since I died I broke my mind now I can never go back
Keep it tricky, like double SX, I keep my bitches intact
That .45 stay within reach, I put six shots in your back
Pop the arches watch me rock it to my zone, I'm a rocket
Then I'ma roll it, no stoppin'
I got that dope in my pocket
I got that anger inside of me
Know the reaper be proud of me
Got my beeper beeping off the hook
Your bitch, she be watchin' me
I don't blame her though (Though)
I keep that blammer low (Low)
My wrist is frostbit (Bit)
My neck is ten below (What?)
It's the return of the pimp, I keep a clip in if they trippin'
Thеy can dish it but can't take it, they fake it, that's whеre we differ
I think I just want what's missin', I fix it up then I break it
My mind is made up of hate now your body is in a vacant
I really gotta go, your money running low
Running on empty, never gonna be me or anyone I know

Blade all on my waist (Waist)
Murder all on my brain (Brain)
Hand down, smoking out the pound
No mask cover my face (My face)
2 stroke in my veins (Veins), bloodline full of pain (Pain)
One look into my eyes and you will see that BONES not playin' (Not playin')
They like my savin's (Savin's)
They copy pastin' my cadence (Cadence)
They can try their best, but I'm not impressed
They'll never be me, they'll never be SESH
Drop back to back fuck a platinum plaque
And it'll be this way 'til I fade to black
And I see the wrap and I stop my brain
Matter fact, this game will never bе the same

I'm off that 40, I'm loaded
I got that .40, you know it
So I bеat that, you don't wanna clap back, better get back, back
Put them in a knapsack, packed like a backpack
I'm off that 40, I'm loaded
I got that .40, you know it
So I beat that, you don't wanna clap back, better get back, back
Put them in a knapsack, packed like a backpack

Down on my luck (Luck)
Hundred fifty blunts (Yeah)
Body in the trunk
Hit the river, then we dump (Dump)
Down on my luck (Luck)
Hundred fifty blunts (Yeah)
Body in the trunk
Hit the river, then we dump (Dump)
Blood cover my razor blades
Bones ready to save the day
Never gave a fuck, fuck
Put them in the truck, truck
Pedal to the metal, then speed away
Blood cover my razor blades
Bones ready to save the day
Never gave a fuck, fuck

You similar to a bitch
You finish when I'm equipped
Step back, pat pat, now you lyin' in a ditch
Sweet dreams as I proceed to get this shit
I got drugs up in my blood and a weapon up on my hip
Hip, hip hooray, hollow point parade
A kevlar coat with a knife, put an end to yo charade
Right click the date, hover up on save
On second thought I delete ya then V12 away
Your name gets erased, brain gets replaced with maggots
I'll make sure that your grave is defaced
Your style is deep fake, you took it and ran with it
Think that you can face me, but you can't even stand with me

Get it how you get it, but don't look to mе
I don't want nothin' to do with you (No, no)
Get it how you get it, but don't look to me (Yеah)
I don't want nothin' to do with you (No, no, no)

From the 517 to the 810, I got ya
Resuscitate the game, call me the doctor
It's the MC rocker, microphone abuser
Class is in session, baby, and I am the tutor
I put two in your melon, I put one in your neck, bitch
All my brothers rockin' skulls, baby, thanks for the necklace
BONES known to kill the crowd like there ain't nothin' to it
You always talk 'bout what you gonna do, well bitch, I do it
#
517 until the grave
.223 at your brain
Two million blunts to the face
Bones 'bout to make a stain

Pulling up, rolling deep
Prototypes on my feet
Touch the paint, you get beat
Touch the ice, feel the heat
Try to rob me? That's a no, no
AUG and that bitch blow, blow
With the team, never ever solo
Push it, shit, push it back in slow-mo
Ayy, switchblade on my body (Body)
Profit all in my pocket (Pocket)
Hit the switch and get to droppin'
Got a '64 with hydraulics (What?)
Boom, now you're doomed
24 karat cover my tomb
Don't make me go back to the shit I used to do (SESH)
Ice cold mason, pressed juice vagrant
Hundred fifty dollar candles posh with the fragrance
Need to leave the city soon, I need me some acres
Raise my son right 'til my bones turn ancient
Back on the motherfuckin' prowl (Woo)
I'm the past and the future and the fuckin' right now
Blunt guts by the pile, only purchasin' in pounds
Habits that I got demand a lot of my account

517 until the grave
.223 at your brain
Two million blunts to the face
Bones 'bout to make a stain

The B, the O, the N, the E, the S
Zero flesh, SESH on my crest
The king of the dead
Makin' a mess, I got ya pressed
I gotcha wrecked
Your mama wept, I heard your shit, I wasn't impressed
Come meet your maker, The Undertaker
I bury the game, make a stain
My mind is clickin', it's time to bang
I leave your residence covered in brains
I took your life now your death is in vain
Go to sleep, blood on your sheets, now crank the heat
My neck on freeze, we sucka free
You talkin' shit but duckin' me
Why can't you see you'll never defeat the one that's I
It's suicide steppin' up to me so long bye-bye
I grip the knife, I twist it twice
I watch your blood all over my hands
I want to feel how warm it gets when it meets the air
No one compares, I got you scared
You heard a creak, you hit the lights but no one's there
Let the murder commence, I disappear into thin air

Always talking shit until I break into your fuckin' door
Blood spilled kill a hoe if you tryna fuck with BONES
Always talking shit until I break into your fuckin' door
Blood spilled kill a hoe if you tryna fuck with BONES

Dope on the countertop, don't think I got a lot
Sippin' cold pressed
Step and press and get your melon popped

Better than that, I'm 'bout to croak
'Bout to kick the bucket, bitch, I'm finna buy the farm, ho'

Got a beeper on his hip and he grippin' on the chrome
Every bone made of gold, pimp cane when he walk
Waterfall when he sip, 9/11 when he spark (SESH)
Ho's on my dick 'cause I'm lookin' like the dead man
Rappers on the line 'cause they wanna cop a reference
Cup in my left hand, blunt in my right (Right)
Stays in the dark and I always need a light
My skin bright white, like snow in the winter (Hah)
BONES big pimpin', now I'm feelin' like Jigga (Yeah)

Dying in the late afternoon, I slowly slip away
Waking up in the afterlife, I knew it was a dream
Dying in the late afternoon, I slowly slip away
Waking up in the afterlife, I knew it was a dream

Death hit me hard, like an eighteen wheeler
Graveyard God, it's the tombstone killer
Raindrop diamonds, I can change the weather
Baby, you can stand under my umbrella, ella, ayy
Fuck what they say
Dead man walking right back to my grave
Crosshair aim straight to the brain
Hangin' out the sunroof, smoking in the rain

Dying in the late afternoon, I slowly slip away
Waking up in the aftеrlife, I knew it was a dream

RYZE

Back with the skeleton raps
Took a trip back home, went to Hell and then back
Head down, I don't know where I'm at
Probably at the cemetery taking dope to the head
Fifty blunts to the neck, with the team that's SESH
I killed the scene with every breath that I got in my chest
Chemicals drippin' down my ribcage, sippin
Straight from the flask, don't ask where I'm steppin'
Poppin' out the grave (Grave), dead boy reppin' (Reppin')
Remember when we used to crack pipes for the resin? (Resin)
Step up and I'm wreckin' (Wreckin'), grippin' on a weapon
It's the mac named BONES kicking legendary records
Don't think for a second I'm stressin', I'm just ventin' (Ventin')
My ideal day will be the day the earth's endin' (Endin')
I see through the character you playin', you pretendin' (What?)
I take you out the game, now you warmin' up the benches, bitch

The underground Dondada
Rock the Carhartt, but they still rock Prada
Dropped the bomb off and pressed the red button
Got 'em like blunts, I light 'em and I summon
The skeletal army, bring the back up for me
Every time you drop, you flop, it's too funny
Turn your back on the only ones who love ya
Your numbers declined and so did your money
That's all you care about because that's all you ever wanted
Tried to do your own thing, couldn't swim, now you're drowning, bitch
But I could never care about it
My lips are sealed, there ain't nothin' I can say about it
I ain't finna play about it, baby come and see me 'bout it
Try to fuck me over, now nobody wanna be around you

SESH, SESH
Yeah

I push 'em back, I lay 'em flat
You sendin' shots, motherfucker, I send 'em back
Your shit is wack, you will get packed
Smokin' thrax, bitches think I'm white trash

Looked in the mirror, I'm lookin' mad
So I turn your music on 'cause I really need to laugh
You twistin' fingers, you think you're bangin'
Better watch what you're claimin'
Bitch, you better watch your back
I could never give a fuck about a person tryna come for me
D-I-E, R.I.P. anybody steppin' up to me
Tombstone terrorist, headstone heathen
How you finna take me out when I ain't even breathin'?

I push 'em back, I lay 'em flat
You sendin' shots, motherfucker, I send 'em back
Your shit is wack, you will get packed
Smokin' thrax, bitches think I'm white trash

One to the two, BONES comin' for you
Three to the four, better call your crew
Five to the six, better lock your shit
Seven to the eight, better hide your bitch (What, what)
Matte black hearse, baby girl, this ain't no drop top
Catch him at the red, make his wheels and his heart stop
Lightin' up the blunt, hit the road when it's dark out
Steppin' with the smart mouth, your dumbass gettin' stomped out
SESH on the tennis chain, Harley on the neck tag
Focus on my craft, you just buggin' 'bout your next bag
Whatever you dream of, you will never get that
You will never get far, pussy boy get back
Ash on my shirt, got blood in my eyes
Sound of the blade make him drop his disguise
S-O-S, never be the best
You'll never be BONES, bitch, you'll never be SESH

I push 'em back, I lay 'em flat
You sendin' shots, motherfucker, I send 'em back
Your shit is wack, you will get packed
Smokin' thrax, bitches think I'm white trash

Baby, don't act like you know me

Nobody steps to me and no one would dare to, yeah
Your bitch, she fancy me, that's why she glance at the team
Prototypes up on my feet
You get stomped out in something unreleased (What?)

Frеsh outta the cemetеry
Your body shaking, you scared of me
Now you will never get rid of me
I will haunt you for eternity
I got the planet in front of me
It's up to me what will happen
Talk to the killer that leave you distracted
Humans will perish when I get to crackin'

When I come through, I be layin' 'em down
Everyone I know is dead to me now
I got the thing that look like I might drown
Rivers of blood flowing just like the Nile
The sun, it go down and then I'm on the prowl
Fuckin' the service, I'm livin' so foul
Everyday been alright up until now
Ready to slaughter then back on the prowl
Now they runnin' like a track meet, I know
Sittin' in the backseat with the scope
I be on attack, please watch your tone
I don't wanna do it to 'em
But if they push me, I might have to
If they push me, I might have to (SESH)
#
Rip it then slip in your body bag
Shake it then dip and I'm out of there
Poppin' the drop and they got his ass
That don't concern me
I would be nothin' without the past
Drippin' it, whippin' it out the dash
I do this shit all without the mask
If you try to burn me, I will come back as a skull made of ashes
Dark shadow blunts smokin', exhale magic
Lookin' like Christ, I light with a passion
I will leave you and yours livin' off rations

Switchblade on my dick, I'm rollin'
I ride with the team, they know this
Do the most tryna get the world to notice
They like mine, wonder why they don't like your shit?

Money in the bank (Bank), tens in my face (Face)
Wasn't in thе race, still I got first place (Place)
Brain full of hatе (Hate), blood full of dope (Dope)
Heart full of pain (Pain), blunt full of hope (What?)
(Shh) Keep it quiet for a minute
Tick tock go the clock at the drop of a penny
Thought you heard a creak in the floorboard denny
Poltergeist Bones checkin' neckin' with the business (What?)
Eject button, now you're out of commission
Long hair swingin' like one of my bitches
Off the dome, smooth, could've sworn that I picked it
I can dish it out, break it down, then fix it
Hard work classic, the fit it say Pistons
Brown liquor sippin', lethal weapon I'm grippin'
Came up from the dark, now it's sunny, like Liston
Always keep it on me, buddy, it's best if you don't risk it

Switchblade on my dick, I'm rollin'
I ride with the team, they know this
Do the most tryna get the world to notice
They like mine, wonder why they don't like your shit?

In the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
Jump in the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
You don't wanna meet that boy, no
You don't wanna meet that boy, no

Smokin' it back to back, uh
Fuck all your platinum plaques, uh
I don't see nothing, boy, fuck a discussion
I'm creepin' up through the back, uhh
Coke white skin (Skin)
Buggy eyed Benz (Benz)
I don't want your bitch but I bet she gon' fuck my friends
Amen
Check mate
Take your life then I skate
'Sean O'Haire' with that iced neck, looking like a ring (Ring)
Live in effect ('fect)
Fuck around and get wrecked (Wrecked)
When she see a skull, all she think about is SESH (What)
Skeleton gang (Gang)
Death up on my brain (Brain)
If you in my range, I'ma bang, that's a stain
I'ma boogie to the left, I'ma groove to the right
Monster mash on the gas, green light, outta sight
Baby, it's my party, I'ma die if I want, bitch
Action when I'm yellin', read the script and play your part bitch
Somewhere in the dark bitch, dwellin', just a carcass
Headstone, here lies Bones, the prince of darkness

In the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
Jump in the Cadillac, bitches know it's me
You don't wanna meet that boy, no
You don't wanna meet that boy, no

If you were to tell me I'd be at where I'm at now
Back in Howell, I'd had said, "You in denial now"
It's like a fallen star fell into my hands
Almost got El a Bentley but he said he like the Benz now
Lookin' all around at my team, ain't no friends
Just brothers, for my blood, I would take one to the head
It's the lord of the dead, it's the prince of the tomb (Tomb)
Pimp named Bones, butterfly be the tool (What?)
Cristal poppin', smokin' dope in the pool (Pool)
Ain't familiar with the game? You can read it on the jewels
I love the road but it's nice bein' home
The fruits of my labor on the line, hold the phone

Weapon in the back (Back), steppin' to the front (Front)
Money on my mind, I'ma do just what I want (Want)
Bitch you gettin' packed (Packed), fuckin' with the skeleton
Get your man sent to hell, fold 'em like I'm mailin' 'em
Weapon in the back (Back), steppin' to the front (Front)
Money on my mind, I'ma do just what I want (Want)
Bitch you gettin' packed (Packed), fuckin' with the skeleton
Get your man sent to hell, fold 'em like I'm mailin' 'em (Who is that?)

Creepin' out the door, a quick reminder, gotta knock him out
Diamonds iridescent, neck and wrist lookin' like a waterfall
Soldiers at my beck and call, Bones never fled at all
Better tread lightly, road is icy, you might slip and fall
Who you think you foolin'? We coolin', pop up and X 'em out
You not even a blip on my radar, you're late, now cut it out
Hunker down, buckle up, I'ma take you on a ride
Hundred days, hundred nights, see you make it out alive
BeanNighe, waitin' in the riverbed (Bed)
Thinkin' back on life, shit was so simple then
Then again, I ain't have much to live for (For)
The day I died, I found out what I was here for

Weapon in the back (Back), steppin' to the front (Front)
Money on my mind, I'ma do just what I want (Want)
Bitch you gettin' packed (Packed), fuckin' with the skeleton
Get your man sent to hell, fold 'em like I'm mailin' 'em
Weapon in the back (Back), steppin' to the front (Front)
Money on my mind, I'ma do just what I want (Want)
Bitch you gettin' packed (Packed), fuckin' with the skeleton
Get your man sent to hell, fold 'em like I'm mailin' 'em

If your words are telling
When you say you don't need me
I know you've been dwelling
On something new
I took a look at your personal change
In contrast with your fathers traits
I know you don't wanna say it
So I'll be your tongue
I fell in love with your social cues
I stood by when you gave me clues
On how to get to know you
But still I came up short

Dropped down and spin around
I'm on lockdown, boy lost and found
I wanna talk to you but I know that I can't, so
I'll have to settle for your dreams in the meantime

Don't wake me up, I'm just starting
To see you when I dream, stay
I'm falling for you now
My guard is down

I got both hands up, you can shoot if you want to
But I don't wanna love anyone if it's not you
I'm falling down
I would love to talk but I can't right now
Woah-oh, you tried to tell me
I know you tried to save
My life and all around me
But you left and took the easy way

Don't wake me up, I'm just starting
To see you when I dream, stay
I'm falling for you now
My guard is down

[Instrumental Outro]

Bitch, I'm feelin' like the Baja man the way I let them dogs out
Weapon up on my body, steppin' to Bones will be the wrong route
What in the fuck are you talkin' 'bout?
Your whole shit is going south
Bitch, I am the WeatherMan, I clap and now it's pourin' out
Rain rain, go away
Layin' back up in my grave
Blunt smoke runnin' all through my veins
Sun is up, I hide away
Shoot like I'm Hardaway
If you ever step in range
If you never seen me snap, I promise you never witness rage
Bitch, I be rollin' in the rain (backseat, bleedin' out)
Shit'd be different if I change, but that ain't an option now
Blinkin', I was darkened out, storm clouds, rollin' out
Morticians, they see me and they swiftly roll the red carpet out

Back up in my zone (Zone)
I am what is wrong (Wrong)
Ride up to the cemetery, Daddy's home (What?)
Smoke another one (Down)
Pour another cup (Up)
I don't need much to continue my roll
#
Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
When I was comin' up, bitches died and now they bite flows
Wrist like a light show, glisten while the time pass
Pop you while you playin', do you the same way they did Dimebag

Jumpin' up in and I'm lettin' it go
Bumpin', you buggin', got no where to go
Fuck a discussion, I'm killin' a flow
Turnin' up Bones, always stick to the pros
Fuckin' with me and I promise you die
Homicide victim, now your mama cry
Don't get caught slippin', hang you out to dry
One in the air before I go to slide
High when we ride, bulletproof caravan
Like a soccer mom, see it and say, "That can't be them"
No need for alarm, I'm just checkin' in
I know your whereabouts and how you livin', man
The graveyard warden, tombstone holdin'
Heard your shit once, it's like you're trying to be boring
First class boarding, 'round the world touring
El booked the shows and my family sends your orders

Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
#
Lock the door
Come and get some more
In my cup, know I keep the most
Here's a toast, roll it then I gotta go ghost
Veins cold, blood collectin’ frost
On his every move, I know your whereabouts
Stop tempting Bones, I'ma be up in your house
Wrist slit, red flowin' like a fount
Ask your bitch, I bet she know what I’m 'bout
Eyes roll back, speakin' to myself
Peel my nails back, lungs pitch black
Can you feel that? Screaming, I don't hear that
Nothin' that I fear more than getting what I give back


They jump back and forth, they never know what side they on
I stay on track, crack the rats, they know what time I'm on
Watchin' what you love crash and burn like my pops when the Lions on
Stay down, now we all up, too high like notes when Mariah's on
Offset, I went off center, I’m too cashed to spell it out for you
Don’t go to bed, I fall in it
But I rarely sleep 'cause I gotta get it
If I fumble, we all fucked, now it’s me whose gotta go live with it
Street ball, skip to my lou, live in the rec, too sick wit' it
I don't need ice but I got a lot
Don't need love but I get it too
I got what I always wanted, doin’ what they told me to never do
It would deafen you if you were in my head
Screams comin' from the afterlife, from beyond the grave
I'm the one whose dead so it is I whose gotta deal with the plight
I fall and now I coincide, it's a fine line 'tween you and I
You blame the world, I tame the world I made the world work for me and mine
I come alive, each and every rhyme, heart beatin' with every line
Night time be the right time, sun goes down, I get a peace of mind
#
A heavyweight in this game, there's no disputin' me
SESH broke the laws, yeah, we led the mutiny
You think you're worthy? Then you gotta go and prove to me
Rehashin' my old flows, no, that ain't new to me
And I ain't mad at you, actually it's quite the opposite
Flattered I inspired you, won't judge and say you copying
That's just somethin' I feel I got to go mention
I feel humbled that they blessed me with the crown to begin with
Rolled out the carpet, led me to my throne
Where I can spend the rest of my days as King Bones
No need to bow down, no need to pay tribute
After all, I did this for me and not you
If the planet went deaf, know I'd still be flowin'
Don't need receivers to continue with the bombs I'm throwin'
'Cause dreams grow mould and money always run out
So light the candles, run the bath and relax like Wine’s house
I've seen 'em stunt now but I'm never bummed out
I guess the uppers they were poppin' got 'em all run down
I put this bitch on lockdown, survival of the fittest
Gon' need more than a bust down to bust out

It goes on and on
Shit never stop 'til I'm dead and gone
And even then, SESH will live on
Two hundred years from now, they'll be singing along
It goes on and on
Shit never stop 'til I'm dead and gone
And even then, SESH will live on
Two hundred years from now, they'll be singing along

Break it down to a science for me, I got to know
Life comes at you quick when you livin' in slow-mo
When every door close and you hear the double bolt
I suppose you gotta flow to hold on, whatever rows your boat
I've always had a hard time with cuttin' my losses
Years past, life goes, still I'm here, dreamin' 'bout ya
Wake up feelin' puzzled, I don't know what I feel
Some days, I just wanna get numb and not feel
But I know that I got to, no matter how hard it is
Tears drop, time don't stop, there's no pausin' it
More than not, I feel this gift is a punishment
Everyone die alone, green light, there's no stoppin' it

Goes on and on
Shit never stop 'til I'm dead and gone
And even then, SESH will live on
Two hundred years from now, they'll be singing along
It goes on and on
Shit never stop 'til I'm dead and gone
And even then, SESH will live on
Two hundred years from now, they'll be singing along

I was in the whip alone, on my mobile phone
Tryna figure out the play while the night was young
Reclinin' on butter pecan leather seats
Same color as my drink, Buffalo Trace
Got a message from my brother on call
Told me, "Slide, get high, figure out what the move is"
Said, I'll be right there, my chain don't fight fair
The diamonds always bitin', jewelry game is a nightmare
Pulled up, hopped out, hit the button
They buzzed me up, then I noticed somethin'
The glim west building had a bloody red glow
All I see is silhouettes movin' 'round in the window
Suddenly my interest shifted
All of a sudden, I'm dyin' to know the business
Quickly hit a 180, took the stairs to the sidewalk
Detective Bones, on the case like it was my job
I knocked twice on the door and the music stopped
The red lights turned off, maybe they thought it was cops
The doorknob twist, to my surprise
It was a female skeleton with gemstone eyes

In the whip alone on my mobile phone (Skeletal love)
I was in the whip alone on my mobile phone (Skeletal love)

Excuse me ma'am, I don't mean to bother
But somethin' magnetic brought me to your door
And I know we haven't met before and that's facts
But lookin' at you now, somehow, I feel we have
She waved me in, led me into the living room
Ironic 'cause she's dead and me, I gave up living too
I sit down while she walks to the kitchen
Brings back a cup of blood with no ice in it
I know it's strange to say the least but I drink it
I don't even hesitate, let alone start thinkin'
Her eyes start blinkin' and her mouth open up
She emits a beepin' sound, then I woke up

Skeletal love

This is definitely not what I thought it would be
You don't owe me a thing and I don't wanna breathe
Honestly, you're everything I wanted to be
'Til I saw the truth and now it follows me
Thought maybe, just a little more time with you
Would change how I view, the situation that we're in
It was a sorry attempt, just a minor offense

Don't call on me, don't fall for me
I will let you all down
Don't call on me, don't fall for me
I will let you all down

I got a feeling I'm goin' back where they call my name
No, don't sweat it, baby, forget it, I will regret it anyway
I wouldn't lie to you, even though I make you lie to me
Sick and you're tired of me, I know this ain't what you wanna be

Don't wait on me, don't change for me
I will let you all down
Don't wait on me, don't change for me
I will let you all down

Get a hold of yourself
I don't need you, shame that I ever did
It's been a month since I felt anything at all
Waiting for the hammer to fall

Cobble stone road, bottles on froze
(Hehehe) You think that's funny?

Cobble stone road, bottles on froze
Stumblin' through the cold, in my SESH skull coat
This village is my home, killers on the phone
Rob you for a dollar, hands up like roll call
Crimes unsolved, bodies they dissolve
I made up a world like I'm fuckin' Roald Dahl
Never heard your songs, I don't play along
You-you on the bench, I'm the center like Gasol
Bitch I'm so appalled, don't mention me
When you bringin' up clones, they ain't next to me
That's a product of me, just a result of the team
Without me there would be nobody botherin' me
I solemnly swear, that was never my plan
Gettin' sick of playin' big brother to all these lil' men
I'm done with it, ain't havin' fun with it
For eight summers I've been comin' with that bumpin' shit
The tavern never closed, my coins all gold
'Nother round for the team, another toast to Bones, cheers

('Nother toast to Bones) What?
There is a place that I'd like to go
It's in my head, so I'm always alone

Hoppin' out the chariot, swangin' (Swangin')
Stainless steel be the weapon (Weapon)
'94 boy like Tekken (Tekken)
If your man talk about me then protect him
Once I start it up there's no ending (Ending)
Depending on what kinda day I've had
Reachin' for me, get fucked instead
Bitch, it ain't my fault (No, no)
Spider silk robes drag when I walk
Royalty blunts get rolled when I want
Castle with the moat, you ain't ever gettin' in
I remember back then, never fittin' in
Now they tryna seal me like the game
I would do the same but I got nothin' to gain
You could never put me on shit that I ain't
Already on, be gone
#
I feel alone, even when you're standing right next to me
Not long ago, I swore that you were what's best for me
Oh, how long?
Oh, how long?
Breathing slowly, I'm not the only one let down
I know you told me, you're the one for me, but my doubts
Keep me up when I know I should be sleeping
Everyday passing, my mental weakens (Weakens)
There's no use in pretending

Cash for days, keep a blade
On my waist, baby, on my waist
Try to rob me? You're done
Bitch, no way, motherfucker, no way
(SESH)

Check it out, yo

Every time I kick it, it's off the richter
Ain't nobody sicker, the witness cat-pillar
In my community, I'm something like a pillar
Mister Bones give, you take, that's where we differ
Me and my brothers, lounging at the villa
Rolling up killer while we bump J Dilla
Dissing you might be better, but killing you will be quicker
So I come equipped with the tools I know will bring ya
To your knees, dot your I's, cross your T's
SESH is now in your world and we don't plan to ever leave
You now rocking with the best in the universe
Give the girl you with love, then we give you a hearse

Better pay respect
The dead man drop bombs, make you break your neck
Better pay respect
The team defy the laws of physics and then we wreck
Better pay respect
The dead man drop bombs, make you break your neck
Better pay respect
The team defy the laws of physics and then we wreck

I never had no interest in going platinum
That is for self-congratulators, lacking the passion
They should go give it up, but I promise they won't
They got four, five managers, needin' financial dose
Watch it melt in the light, throw your ice in the sky
Record label take the cake, leave you a slice of the pie
Just enough to buy your drugs and the mansion you like
Now you a slave to a life that ain't treatin' you right (Uh)
The writing's on the wall but most choose to ignore
Ignorance is truly bliss when you know that you done wrong
Deep down, I wish that I could save 'em
But they too far gone, baby, who the fuck raised you?

Better pay respect
The dead man drop bombs, make you break your neck
Better pay respect
The team defy the laws of physics and then we wreck
Better pay respect
The dead man drop bombs, make you break your neck
Better pay respect
The team defy the laws of physics and then we wreck

Roll through the city, windows down
Whippin', I got too many hoes
Fur coat, barely trimmin'
Pimp cup for the sippin', I got Alize to pour
More dope in the duffle
No, Bones never tussle, I just let the .45 blow
Top down, see me stuntin'
One push of the button, I go jumpin' down the road

Ash on the dash, pass me the badge
Ice in the glass, baby, I'm gone
Motherfuck a mask, I won't do you bad
I'm just cruisin' these city streets

And you (And you, girl)
Singin' in the car, like, "Doo, doo, doo"
And you (And you, girl)
Singin' in the car, like, "Doo, doo, doo" (Ayy)

Ice bucket with the Chardonnay by the fireplace
What a good year, popped a cork
Now she ridin' waist
Sunken living room, lookin' like it's eighty two
White shag rug, lay you down, turn to tomb-zone
Al Green vinyl, let it turn, get my groove on
I'ma take it slow, baby, let you do what you want
Lava lamp, blowin' skeleeton
High rise, floor 105
Penthouse suite, you and I

Baby, it's just me and you
We don't gotta tell 'em what we do
Baby, I know you
And by tonight, you finna know me too

Hold my hand lets chase the sun

Nothin' feels that real without you
Wanna learn so much about you
You're blown away, you're all, you've never, you've been doing this for a while, you've been runnin' around, you've been runnin' around, you've uh, you've hit up everyone, you shot it all up man, they can't believe that

Give a fuck about your clique, SESH forever running shit
South bound, whipping downtown rolling out the zip
Only gifted what I get
Hell, I never could forget
All them nights that I was down
Bitch you never had my back
Now the money stupid quick
Like I came up on the brick
Dead man's land
Tryna step up, I promise you'll get hit
From a hundred yards away
Body cold, you deceased
5k for the scope
We don't even gotta meet
It's the cemetery freak
From the SHWB
Skin the same color coat
Hoes lining up for me
Got the team on their feet
Tyrus Creek up on the Tee
Everything I do is SESH
And any time we out, we deep
Bitch it's MisterTenBelow
I was raised in the snow
One touch got you froze
Ain't nobody cold as Bones
I'm the wind in the trees, I'm the shiver in your spine bitch
Time after time, I got proof the game is mine, shit
SESH

You don't get no warning shots, baby better get low
You don't get no warning shots, baby better get low
You don't get no warning, you don't get no warning

Fuck a 8th, where the O's, let me buy, buy, buy
Timberlake with the K, say bye bye bye
Got my hand on ya bitch, yea she mine, mine, mine
Anytime I get low, I get high, high, high

.45 on my side, come and try, try, try
Put your hands in the sky, or you'll die, die, die
Now it's time to unwind
Windows down in the ride
Phone off, seat back, don't try and hit my line
Flow aged like wine, sip it now she fine
Negative mind, baby Bones not kind
Poison in my lungs, dopin' till I'm done
Bury me alive with a 150 blunts
Lit, I'ma split
Like a kid thrown a Bic
Always yappin' how you stacking, spendin' bands on your bitch
Get ran for your shit, get robbed for your life
Set fire to your ice, watch you melt in the light

I got 2 bad bitches sucking at the same time
The way they have my toes curled up should be a crime
Roll me up some killer, bitch, I smoke that homicide
Doctor did a CAT scan, he said "Boy ya brain's fried"
I sent goons out to meet ya, it won't be no drive-by
Put a ticket on ya head, now that's money on ya mind
Nine figure nigga, yeah, multimillionaire
All my ice hittin', I feel like a Frigidaire
Tony Montana with the gold silverware
And I come from north Memphis, lions, tigers, grizzly bears
All these niggas hatin' cause I'm winnin' and they ain't
All these quarters in my lungs, I feel like a piggy bank
I feel like a piggy bank
I feel like a piggy bank
All these quarters in my lungs, I feel like a piggy bank
What you hoes think?

Fuck a 8th, where the O's, let me buy, buy, buy
Timberlake with the K, say bye bye bye
Got my hand on ya bitch, yea she mine, mine, mine
Anytime I get low, I get high, high, high

BONES in the house, the roof is on fire
Spit gasoline, D-19 messiah
Whickr whickr, Boy I came back to spite 'em
Ain't nobody higher my lighter will help guide 'em
To a whole new layer, you dare, but you just can't
My whole life was spent in the boot camp for the damned
Your two cents is worthless, makin' me nervous
Heard your shit it's like you're tryin' to be wack on purpose
Proficient in killin' off every wack MC
And it'll stay that way until I D-I-E
Almost been 10 years since I came on the scene
And ain't a motherfucker ever try to step to me

(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz, they know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend
(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz, they know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend

Just like Ponyboy I stay golden
Neck, hands, wrist, every ring be frozen
Anytime that you see BONES, just know I'm holdin'
Aromatic rollin', smokin' and chokin'
100 spoke rims on the 64 pokin'
Kickin' this game for free, you just do this shit for tokens
Money, fame, and whatever it brings
All I see is depleted minds when I look at the scene
Just some drugged out pussies that simply couldn't handle
Stepping up to BONES let alone holdin' the candle
But I am numb to this stuff as I huff, and I puff, and I blow down these blunts

(Back again with something new to hate)
They know the biz, they know just who it is
(Back again with something new to hate)
Try their best but they cannot defend

Acting like you different, but you just like them
Everything you hate, everything you hate
Tryna be like us, but you'll never get there
We everything you ain't, everything you ain't
Blood on the ground, my blood hold me down
Now my brother keep a, keep a clean hunnid rounds
Rappers acting tough, like they can't get touched now
Got 'em on the ground lookin' 'round like they lost some

Fuck it, we got through,  we put 'em up in the trunk
Actin' like killers 'til someone pull up and dump
Ain't nobody fucking with my crew, I know
Comin' down, never know
Swangin' in a yellow fo', Swangin' in a yellow I hit the dope, hit the dope
Money come, money go, money go
Go

Waiting for my plane at the terminal
I get so high, get vertigo
I think I need some time alone

Feel like I'm 'bout to die, yeah no-no-no
I do not wanna find out where we go
Nowhere, is that where?
I won't be disappointed if somewhere where no one know me
Why would you tell me, that everything's full of purpose
You say nothing, I never notice
Cause I don't believe it, well I don't believe it

Fuck it, we got through, we put 'em up in the trunk
Actin' like killers 'til someone pull up and dump
Ain't nobody fucking with my crew, I know
Comin' down, never know
Swangin' in a yellow fo', Swangin' in a yellow I hit the dope, hit the dope
Money come, money go, money go

Medieval bandits, I practice with all you bastards
Lay 'em on a rack, now I'm cracking up as they passin'
Ash 'em like tobacco, I cash 'em and then I stack 'em
They wonder how it happened, now I'm enveloped in madness
Champagne in the graveyard, toast to the KR's
Two twelves in the trunk banging like a AR
I gotta thank y'all for helping me take off
Yet to truly try, 'cause I know if I did, I'd break y'all
Down to sediment, problem let's settle it
You need to stop sipping and popping all of them sedatives
That shit don't heal you
That shit won't help you
That shit just break you
And put you in hell, true
Been speaking this for years
A lot of people laughed
'Til they laying on they back knowing this breath's the last
I wouldn't wish that on any human
Only thing I'm concerned about is bringing the music

The original hundred SESH songs stay on repeatedly
The ones that nobody's heard, I bump 'em religiously
The guideline to this shit that I now bring you
You ain't gotta try when you know that it's in you
Garage nights, Double wide-wraps, double stuffed
That was the recipe for the shit that we bump
Old news, cold tunes, and gold jewels
Scholar like shoes, Young Duke in a suit
Pocket watch ticking, Sweater un-tucked
They say it's preparation, I say that it's dumb luck
No such thing as fate when you don't give a fuck
White Punk On Dope coming straight up out the dump
SESH
#
Where were you, before we met?
I've been trying on, the things that you left
Make me feel, like a man
Like I'm wanted, like I'm wanted again
Where were you, were you by yourself?
Oh I just assumed, you were with somebody else
I'm so insecure, nobody knows it but you
I wish I was numb and didn't have to show you
I wish I was numb, I wish I was numb
I wish I was numb and didn't have to show you

No one to blame, only myself, and decisions I've made
Slipping and falling and crawling away
I wanna talk, but there's nothing to say
My yesterday was the same as today
Without you with me, I'm blowin' my brains out
Trippin', tryna' find a way out
Life is so clearly played out
Blood in my veins, clip in the K
Once I get bangin' I leave 'em decayed
Truly I feel like my mental has changed
Somewhere along the road that I made
Digging my grave, making my bed
Mud on my body, I'm layin' my head
SESH
#
I know you're angry, I just wish that I could
Build you up when you are down
But I've got nothing in my box of tools that could be useful on a day like this
I hope you're better off without me with you
I was your tomb, all I did was bury you
I know you're hurting, I just wish that I could
Build you up when you are down
Build you up, build you up
#
You don't wanna die
Tell me now
Get dropped then we make your body rot
Let it fly, never lie
And say bye-bye to your life
On the spot, Ima do this shit tonight
No time to be getting in a fight
Drop a bomb on your block, goodnight
Sweet dreams, don't let the nightmares bite
Life in my cup, I got death on my right
Try with all your might but you'll never be I
I took my neck and I put it on ice
We took your life and showed you to the light
Ima take it way back, now you're jacked
Let my coat, next we get ya smokin' shit that smell like Ajax
Cashed like paychecks
Wrapped like safe sex
On the webcam
Like 'Bones where the daze is?'

I don't really give a fuck about that
Motherfuckers get jacked, talking down on SESH
Pulling up, all black, from the boots to the masks
See your past from the flash when the .45 blast on your ass
This oughta solve 'em
Mathematician when there is a problem
Young white magician, up in smoke vanish
Disappear clean, maybe go and peep the language
#
Jumpin' outta bed with a quest
Gotta go fulfill this destiny
I'd agree any you legends would just copy and paste what's left of it
Cold press my juice, I'm revitalized
Where there's magic, there's SESH
I've said it a hundred times
I reside on the line before the other side
I feel confined to this life, I'm tryna die tonight
In cold blood, I'm going out

Ride in the Blanco Benz
Motherfuck your fucking friends
Posted on the fucking tens
Step in, lose a fucking limb
5% on the tint
Live when we hit the street
Jive motherfuckers been jockin' this, can you dig that?
Pussy push your wig back
Get your fucking bitch snatched
In a different bracket, what you know about this tax?
Quickly hit the dispatch, on your whole team bitch
I could show you violence that you never could've dreamed, shit

In cold blood, I'm going out

I don't wanna know
If my life is working
I don't wanna know
If my days are numbered
#
I done put my heart in it
Could touch the stars with it
I'm ridin' 'round the city, with my hand low
Water in my bottle
When I drown my sorrow
All my nightmares follow
Don't wanna live here at all
Now now now, bitch you should've known
Pow pow pow, now yo ass on the floor
Bones finna make it dark
I get out of any charge
I'm at large, going far
Take your life and take 'em all
I can see it in your eyes you just counterfeit
Fake racks, fake life, you so out of it
Wasn't fuckin' with me back in the drought and shit
Now we up and you actin' like you down and shit
I don't know, if I really want you
I had dreams where I'll be good without you
In my head I'm tryna find the route to
My escape
#
Skaleaton, Skaleaton, Skaleaton, Skaleaton

B-B-Beatin' down your block, with that new shit (new shit)
B-Beeper on my hip, money I'm gon' get (get)
T-Treat me like the reaper, 'cause I never miss
It'd be che-cheaper to kill yourself and just save me a trip
I've got no reason to make a scene, but best believe I will
Commit treason against the team and get your blood spilt
Get your head split
Get your mind right
Raise out and hit the town until the nighttime, I ride
Baby I've been thinkin' I'ma fall right down
Without you by my side my life is over now
I'ma ride, I'ma slide, in the candy paint
I'ma dip my dope in the kerosene
No trip (trip)
I'ma sip (sip)
I'ma shake the game and watch 'em all flip (flip)
Get a grip (grip)
Bass kick (kick)
That bitch you said you love she, she on my dick
What?

"???"
"Give me that”
“Don’t shoot!”
"Don’t shoot?! You stupid, ignorant son of a bitch, dumb bastard. Jesus Christ I've met some dumb bastards in my time but you outdo them all! Get over here"
#
Now my lungs are feeling heavy and I can't breathe
(I can't breathe)
I think my eyes are slowly going blind
Without you I can't see
What is the point of goin' on
When every time I turn around
I sing the same old song (it goes...)
Singing it to, the ocean
I don't expect you to understand
The words I'm saying, they're only bubbles
Breaking on the surface to save you the trouble

Sinking, sinking
Hoping, wishing
Sinking, sinking
Hoping, wishing
#
(What?)

Ain't nobody wanna think about how they be wastin' time
It is so much easier to sleep and then unwind
Whatever is comfortable, humans make a cycle of it
Same shit everyday, no matter if they get nothin' from it
I feel in a rut when I don't make at least a few flows
Bones gotta make Sesh songs every 24
This is how I let loose, this is how I black out
Some paint, me, I get the beat and lay the smack down
Let my hair down, bang my head to the bass
Dope to the face, candles lightin' up the place
It's the pace to my workflow that let me live this life
One hand watch the other while I, I work a mic
Nothin' landed in my lap and nothin' was handed to me
I spent ten thousand hours just to see how insane I could be
Others want results without ever takin' the steps
Want to see the rain but they afraid of gettin' wet
#
Your hands in mine for eternity
Your plans not mine like they ought to be
Everyday I wake up and can't believe
I see your face
Smiling back at me
What did I do right
Cause it must've been something
You believed in me, when I believed in nothing
#
It's funny how stories start out
So true until the time comes they get passed down
Like a game of telephone
It's always wrong by the end of it
The whole origin's off
They let these other crackers tell that there was no Bones
But name every other clone that copped my flows
It's fine, it's cool, I don't need no praise
The accolades that I've acquired mean more than the fame
The most known 'unknown', that was my end goal lane
The underground god, I'll be that to the grave
So listen up close and solve this game
SESH militia on a tank turn your buildings to flames (what?)

Even my closest of friends
Still can't understand why I am the way I am
And I can't either, I feel your pain
And I can't blame you, 'cause I feel the same
It's like I'm on a team and sometimes, I feel camaraderie
But on the other hand, I feel alone like I oughta be
Kickin' rocks by myself down the road
I thought we made together but I guess I was wrong
Maybe I'm caught up in my own emotions
Always been sensitive and full of these problems
Too quick to feel 'em, too slow to solve 'em
But if I neglect 'em, it is I who's dissolvin'

I'm my own downfall, there’s nobody to blame
I'm my own downfall, I’ll never be right again
#
I'mma take 'em back to the days
When we used to stay
Down in the basement
Jack Frost was comin'
The winter was among us and the snow fell hard
So we got so fucked up we couldn't feel the cold
Your neck all gold and your wrists all froze
But what the fuck that mean when the reaper at your door?
The weakness in your flow
I peeked it from the jump
Whole body numb every day I'm fucked up
Don't mean to showboat
But I am just so-so
Deaf like Dupree when I'm hearin' your solo
My pants is cargo
The blunt like Sade
Smooth operatin' 'til we all get paid
Hey
You got cash to blow
That's fine, I still know a better place it could go
Like a Detroit group home
Rock like Cubone
BONES stay spittin' like a motherfuckin' tooth gone

Everything fine, everything good
I don't got shit to complain about
Earth fucked up, everybody fucked
There ain't no point for me to shout

I'm like the Mink Man
I sic my dogs on ya
I'm like the fish man
Put a fish tank in your Civic
So prolific
.44 tippin'
Keep a 33 on my back like Pippen
For all y'all trippin'
No more bitchin'
To me, motherfucker
You know I can't give in
Way too focused
I'm way too noticed, the young Russian prince
And I ain't even fuckin' from there
No one compares to us, it's almost unfair
Swear on my mama it isn't
You could scream in our direction
Still never get our attention (It's real)
(What)

Everything fine, everything good
I don't got shit to complain about
Earth fucked up, everybody fucked
There ain't no point for me to shout

RYZE

You got a false image
Bitch, I got no limits
You trip, I slap a clip in
I'm banging chrome finish
Don't be another victim
You pussies try to fit in
This fuckin' scene is sickenin'
It's scary how I'm livin'

I fall asleep and pass away, then wake up blunt twistin'
Even if I'm drowning like Whitney, I keep a razor with me
Cool it down like New Edition, then go froze when you see me
I don't fuck with the city, rather be in the forest
Solar cells up on my cottage, hear the birds in the morning
Earl Grey in my kettle
Off the grid how I settle
Super tramp how I travel
This how I cope with my mental
I engrained myself in history bitch I'll be here forever

I be so on my shit I'ma foreclose your big scene
No, you not like me
So when night fall she dip, dip
Pager all on my hip, hip
Whole game on my dick, dick
Motherfuck yo clique, give a fuck what you think, bitch (SESH)

I lift it up and I'm shaking the earth
Sharpen my blade and I'm bringin' the hurt
Deep in the dirt, hittin' the curb
Bitch don't talk to me, don't get on my nerves
Cashed as a bitch now I'm slurring my words
This my confession, I'm letting it burn
Told you already, bitch when will you learn?
SESH is forever till I'm in the earth
Bitch

Fuck it
Now you duckin'
When I say I got the shooters, baby
No no, I'm not bluffin'
Bustin'
Why you cuffin'?
Hoes they be so obvious
They out here suckin' fuckin'
Duffle
Full of dope
Smoke
Till you choke
King BONES
Bouta build a moat
On my throne
Hand crafted outta gold
In my coat
I keep a weapon
I'll let it show
If you keep on steppin' (keep on steppin')
Start the wreckin'
But you don't wanna breathe (wanna breathe)
Take your lungs
Watch your body deep freeze

These motherfuckers never own shit
Airplane mode activated, don't call bitch
These motherfuckers never own shit
Airplane mode activated, don't call bitch

Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame
Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame

Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame
Quicksand my brain, it's like I'm sinkin' in the pain
I sleep all day so I be woke all night
The second BONES come around, watch how they walk on thin ice
I kick nice raps and rhymes
That's all that I like
But I had my fair share of downs, cause I'm at a new point in my life
While you droolin' over some bitch
We makin' these hits
That microphone in my fist has paid for all of this shit
You see the whip, the house, the jewels, and clothes
But you don't see the inside of my mind when the door closed
I clam up, slam shut, and keep to myself
And there's a reason for that
Look at the world we livin' in
One look around will have you for sure feelin' me
My infamy is difference, see
I'm on a new frequency
That only a few can pick up
Attention all MCs, step to me, get ripped up

Knock, knock, who's there?
It's the man with the plan
It's the corpse with the flows bringin' you to an end
Knock, knock, who's there?
It's the man with the plan
It's the corpse with the flows bringin' you to an end
Yeah

Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame
Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame

I alienate myself from those who love me
Loco still, my social skills is rusty
Slayer like Buffy
My focal point is
Stayin' on track like a locomotive
And if I do crash, whether off or on purpose
I fake my death, move away, and never resurface
I'm the resurgence every time that the drought hits
Lord BONES turn a tapwell to a fountain
Lost track of the classics
I've dropped, I'm done countin'
They live off the flows, I give 'em just like allowance
Gettin' too big for their britches, it's time to hem 'em
Got the underground on lock, I am the deadbolt
Dead shit, buckshot, locked on your head, bitch
Peepin' Tom motherfuckers lookin' over hedges
That's just life for the original
No employee, got our own business now

Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame
Singin' in the rain, dealin' with the shame

Got bored, made a million then I made another
SESH bring the storm, better run for cover
Bitch, I'm a rollie and a number one stunna
You'd stop when it's dark, I'm in this bitch till the sun up
Skeleton gang make 'em run like water
5.56 loaded up in the bullpup
Anywhere we go, people they know us
Don't you lie say you witnessed the come up
Bitch, you know BONES but you don't know Elmo
Def Jam Vendetta, stomping they shelter
Hell yes, I'm the man, are you? Hell no
Then address 'em with the blade, "Hi, how are ya?"

I don't know what you've been thinking
I just want you here with me tonight

SESH on the rise, you know this, know this
When I'm on the block you notice, notice
Everything will be frozen, frozen
Play me, kiss you, Rollie, Rollie
Rock on your motherfuckin' hip, now stop
36 millimeter: my watch
Cold white man pimp on the drop
Best believe I am what you not
I'm focused
Bring the plague, you can hear the locust
Hundred spokes on the old school pokin'
My brain don't pause I'm dopin'
Choose up, fuck being chosen
One in the head, bitch I'm loaded
Fred Durst with the blunt, I'm rollin'
Twilight bitch, you know I'm zonin', zonin'
What?

And it be like that, till the line go flat, till the line go flat
And it be like that, till the line go flat , till the line go flat

SESH
Your so called "clique" full of pussies
Made my own path, just look where it took me
You by the book, we did it playing hooky
Talk your shit online, but never in person
Look me in my face, I dare you to push it
Red alert, now I'm on ya head like a turban
100 dollar J’s to the face, now I’m Irving
Spin the block silly, now your whole team nervous
SESH
#
Time's not on my side
I’ve tried, oh, I tried
No matter I die
Never am I complete
Maybe one day, I'll be
Some things have never been for me
Some dreams will just stay dreams

5-1-7, Mac-11
Pop your fucking head, bitch
2-11, riding Chevys
Drop it off your ass quick
9-11, building seven
Crumpling like my casket
Ducking out so fast, bitch
Bones make it tragic
Feeling something like Tracy Chapman
Fast cars, just overlapped them
You drop and nobody listen
I MMMBop just like the Hansons
Two left feet, I’m never dancing
Let the blade stand in if I’m ever anxious
Out of dope, and all out of patience
Dug my grave, it’s time to get to laying
Mud cover my Rolex, I can never tell the time
We change the game, you stay the same
Rhyme after rhyme

5-1-7, Mac-11
Pop your fucking head, bitch
2-11, riding Chevys
Drop it off your ass quick

Creeping in the back, back
Hop up in the back, back
I don’t fuck with it if it ain’t TeamSESH
Pussy, get back, back
I’m up in the back, back
Fuck Kevlar, I ain’t shooting for the chest
I will let it ride, your body cold, I make it rot
I get it rocking, never gonna stop me
Pay for your fuse, you act like you popping
Now I’m swinging up the coast
Candy paint dripping off me
All your flows been used before
Your catalogue like a swap meet
Crop me out the picture, try your best to banish me
Going ghost, Backwoods smoking
Inhibit your vision, I’m vanishing
Dropping like a damn machine
Don’t extend your hand to me
I’ll reject it, as expected
There’s a reason why the game hate on me
'Cause I hate them all, and everyone involved
You make me cringe, but it’s straight
I needed a laugh today
Creep while you fast asleep
Dead man never pass away
Even when I’m gone off this planet
I live on and beyond with the graves

5-1-7, Mac-11
Pop your fucking head, bitch
2-11, riding Chevys
Drop it off your ass quick

These hoes on me, I don’t love them back
I’m crawling on fours, I’m sipping on yak
These hoes on me, I don’t love them back
I’m crawling on fours, I’m sipping on yak

I keep holding on, holding on
Holding on, holding on
Holding on, holding on
Holding on, holding on

5-1-7, Mac-11
Pop your fucking head, bitch
2-11, riding Chevys
Drop it off your ass quick

SESH
Palm drive, dirt patch
Sippin' slow, smokin' fast
Rockin' chains, flickin' ash
Sparkin' flames, kickin' back
Monogram like dapper dan
SESH on my jacket and pants
I heard you blew your advance
No, I cannot lend a hand
Garbage cans, garbage mans
Livin' in a garbage land
Treat the earth like shit
Then get confused when it don't like us back
Fade to black
Queue the credits
Pull my blade out then direct it
Produce what I go through
Ain't no cut, bitch
All I know is action
Grand west shit
3am stumblin' to the crib
Zoned up, now walking through the mist
To the park where I let my mind rest
See the rest, see if there's a contest
I'm creepin', there's nothin' I don't stress
That's why it's clear BONES the best
Too legendary and nothin' less

Inhale exhale, down on my luck
Twenty five lighters on the dresser, now I'm caught in a rut
My limbs feel numb, now I can't get up
You can go on without me, no need to wait up
#
I don't wanna figure out that I've been on my own
I don't want it anymore to roam around alone
Waiting around for you to come but know you'll never show
Trying hard, I'm holding on, I don't wanna let go
Don't need a vest, no
I'll pop at your head, hoe
I wanna see what's on your mind and let it out export
Swangin' the rover, speakin' to no one
Thinking about you, I'm just thinking it over

Every night, every day
You're on my mind, what can I say?
Every night, every day
You're on my mind, what can I say?

When was the last time that you thought of me
When was the last time you were who'd you thought you'd be
When was the last time that you thought of me
When was the last time you were who'd you thought you'd be
#
When you up, motherfuckers will dap you up
They go behind your back and say it's you that's switching up
Like "all the shit he got, he don't deserve half of it"
The kind that drop a thousand songs before I made a thousand back
I pay them no mind though, it's  in my head, I know
That's just the reflection of insecurities inside, now
Projected onto me like the screen when they feel entitled
The mind goes, start spewing shit to spite you
But it's alright though, everybody has bad days
Just don't waste away blaming others for your fate
You got to get up out of your funk, move your feet
Break your fucking neck, bob your head to the beat

You know that I can't blame you
We all going through something
You know that I can't hate you
We all live for the moment

I gotta disconnect, get away for a while
Couple solar cells in a duffel bag and I'm out
Few jackets, a canteen, and grab my vitamins
In the cabin with a skylight, to let the light in
Sunshine, alpines, grown to the sky
Wanna do, jump on my boots, and I walk by
Don't worry about me, I ain't worried about you
Just had to go somewhere where the surrounding is true
Deadman, fresh air, replenish my lungs
Gratitude only thing I feel when I'm up
I got to see the sky today, I get to see the moon tonight
As soon as I grip the mic, I kill it, how rude am I?

You know that I can't blame you
We all going through something
You know that I can't hate you
We all live for the moment

Through the village I stumble (Stumble)
Feelin' like the Blind Harper (Blind Harper)
I remember they would mumble
That I never get far than that
Look at me truthfully, now you know
Walk to the pass that's covered in snow
Roses all over paved stone
Headin' to the homes of Malibu
My heart is droppin' just like me
Say my goodbyes, know I gotta go
Head to the homes of Malibu
To the homes of Malibu

SESH
Walkin' through the green glade
Hate in my DNA
Life is just a replay
So the game we play
Give 'em no leeway
Motherfuck bein' paid
All I truly need is a shack by Serene Lake
Bein' late, slept in, crows and they nestin'
Right up on my head, on the roof when I'm restin'
Best in, best out, what the fuck you talkin' bout?
Moss on the rocks lead me to your whereabouts
Clear 'em out, layin' down, shoulda never stuck around
DeadBoys on the hunt, know they do not fuck around
And I don't need 'em to believe me
Life, breath, SESH bitch, I'll see ya when I see ya

You know what I mean. This person is indeed a genius, then that geniuses has been given to him as a gift. So, it's not as though it was something that I had done. That's why I never say "I know" instead of "thank you", because if I will say "thank you", then I will be taking the credit for it. Instead, I say "I know", because I know that I've got the gift. Genius. That's very nice. That's very nice. See, see aren't I smart?

Time will play these tricks on us,  standing in the wind
Time will play these tricks on us, standing in the wind
I don't want to go right now
I don't want to go right now
You will be there for me, though
Why would I wait on you?
Genius

Honey, come down
Honey, come down
Honey, come down
SESH (what)

Digging myself out the grave (grave)
Smoking, my vision is hazed (hazed)
Maggots and worms in my brain (brain)
Got to get out of this cage (cage)
Digging myself out the grave (grave)
Smoking, my vision is hazed (hazed)
Maggots and worms in my brain (brain)
Got to get out of this cage (cage)

Grief is one of those that people, people don't really understand. And I think that grief is a part of everybody's life, from what I've experienced. There's nobody who's spared an introduction to grief, or a relationship with grief. There's nothing wrong with you if you feel overwhelmed or overcome by it. I find that to be very common, and so to speak, normal
#
SESH gold chain like the moon that glow
Diamonds on my blade, I do the most
Going gets rough, I knew you'd go
I could change my name and get away from the coast
But no matter how far inland I go
Matter how many times I deny that I'm Bones
I will still be the Dead Man, till I'm burnt into ashes
Let me wipe off my feet, step into the world
Don’t know what to expect
But I got a hunch it's the worst
At a hole in the wall bar
Just give me the works
Greaf on the shirt, Planet Earth on my nerves

Closing time, get home safely if you can
Closing time, you are always on my mind

I hate to say it, I always do- do
Just amuse me, whatever you do
I hurt myself but, it's nothing new- new
Our thoughts are one, they're never two- two
On and on
On and on

Virus

Fuck with me, done with me, I don't give a fuck
Ready to ride, I'm ready to die, I wish you all good luck
Blade on my side, taking your hide
Bitch, a dead man finna cut
Look in my eyes, I'm ready
It's time to show you what the fuck is up
Back with that new shit, ride with the crew, bitch
Skeleton settlin', bones about to crack
I thought you knew, bitch, corpse full of mucus
I be with them tools and I am just so useless
Without my blade, I'm clueless
Swing with the sword, I'm swangin' bitch
Yeah, pop and I drop and I'm slangin' shit
Quit with all the chit chat, that's how you get your ass capped
Hook you with the deadman, hit you like a flashbang
Look where they runnin', you’ll never be safe
I'm on your trail I know your scent
Steppin' up on the scene, rips up in my jeans
Cuts up in my mind, slice you up and leave
I am the one who shanked ya, BONES is naughty by nature
Lay you on the tray, then I fuckin’ cremate ya

Eyes made of emerald
Gold-plated M4
Salute me like "10-4"
Get you paid ten fold
This ain't Ralph Lauren, no
It sure as shit ain't Gucci
Only SESH clothes on my back like Kazooie
Deadboy emblem shine on my chest
Used to be off in a basement, rollin’ up stress
Bag full of sticks, pokin’ holes in the blunt
Ten below zero outside, gettin' numb
Bonfire nights with synthetic in my lungs
Bottles with the ice, Tanqueray in the cups
My whole life has been a blur
Just one long moment in the flame gettin' burnt

What I learned
Don't trust nobody
Those around you will crack a smile when they see you drownin'
What I learned
Don't trust nobody
Those around you will crack a smile when they see you drownin'
What?

I wanna feel your body close to mine
First time I met you
Your beauty almost made me pine
Now all I want is your body close to mine
I swear on everything
I will do you right
Let's take it slow baby
I'm gonna take my time
On you tonight, baby
Underneath the candle light
Let's get this fire started
Told me one more lie
Now we're beyond the line
I am on cloud nine
Whenever I hear you
Your voice brings me life
Every time you're speaking
I drop all my pride
You got my guard down
Run my hands down your spine
Now you got chills, baby
I'll keep you warm tonight
No, don't be scared, baby

You never tell me twice about how you feel
I feel the same, I feel the same
You never tell our friends about what we do
We'll keep this between me and you

Oh woah oh woah
Oh woah oh woah
Oh woah oh woah
Oh woah oh woah

What you wanna do, I've been thinking about it
Testarossa in the parking lot, we could be outtie
Back to my pad, we can relax
Feet up in front of the fireplace
Pour you a glass and we could drink
Or we could smoke
Whatever your preference, baby girl
The world is yours

Body close to mine (You know I want that)
Body close to mine (You know I need that)
Body close to mine (You know I want that)
Body close to mine (You know I need that)

The days are never long enough, my phone is always on six percent
But please just call me back when you get this message
I don't think I'm strong enough to bare this baggage
I don't think I'm wrong
But I appreciate you for saying that

Fall, I fall, I fall again
On and on until the end
Fall, I fall, I fall again
On and on until the end

When you get down to it and you find out
That everything you love
Is just one big fuckin’ joke
It might not be today
Might not be tomorrow
But somewhere down the backroads that we call life you'll see
It’s who we are
It’s who we are
Spin me around, blindfold and all
And act like you never met me
Kept me around like a nail in the wall
Just like UV rays in the night you left me

It’s who we are
It’s who we are

SESH

Who's the wildman now?
I'm Rudy Ruettiger I'll put you on ya back
And now the doctor gotta suture ya
I'm loaded but won't shoot at ya
Got a razor in my boot for ya
I throw them bows like Luda (uh)
We pull up, change the temperature
Real motherfucker, you disloyal
I put you on, embrace you as a brother
You'd be spoiled
Every song a coil in my mind’s turmoil
When they put me in the soil, I'mma make the coffin boil
Floorboards creakin'
You in your room sleepin'
Deadboys silent
We lurkin', we creepin'
Now back up on ya head, bitch
Hit a sweep like the feds bitch
Four double eight four three, motherfuck glory
I do this shit so when I die again, nobody mourn me
Too cashed, I'm soaring
All year you tourin'
Your label needs money and your family needs supportin’

It's Mr. Backroad look I only conversate on burners
White fire make you burn
Chains drag I know you heard us, bitch
Stop, drop, lean with it rock
Snappin' like Dem Franchize Boyz on the block
Always in search of a brighter day
Shoot up the roof and ride away
They said it couldn't be done
But best believe BONES will find a way
Best believe BONES will find a way
They said it couldn’t be done
But best believe BONES will find a way

I'm like a well-oiled, money-making lyric machine
It's only beautiful things in life I quietly see
I admire the things that life silently brings
With little effort on my part, I acquired the means
Ain't retired the blade, so watch how you come up to me
I yellow tape you then hastefully say there’s nothing to see
Do enough for the rain
Had up to here with the sleet
The game without me's like the me without the ambition in me
The world itchin' to see what SESH gon' do next
It's like a mission to me to be a stress-free mess
No one’s speaking to me
I've been turned on to many times
Like, what you see on the TV
Too many lies being told to my face
Like I've been tricked down a dead end
In this rabbit and hare race
But I escaped, just by the skin of my teeth
Still got the heart of a peasant
Now I got the views of a king
What?
SESH
Greaf

Blind shades, brighter days, you know what you mean to me
Darker hues, I feel used
I don't know what you see in me
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop

The syllable killer, the illest of villains
I'm banana clip peelin', if you tryna get near me
I got the MP with me and the Desert Eagle near me
Even if you found me sleeping
One sound and I'm up tweakin'
I'm shooting at the wall, hoping that you fall
Its really nothing at all like hooping at the park
Like it's just light work, but I'm 'bout to make it dark
It's imminent when I spark, bullseye every target
You better plan on ending it, if you plan to start shit
I'm shooting up to Mars in the death star ship
I take it to different lengths, I blessing like pocket tanks
I'm good like no thanks, I brought my own things
Resources by the vault, I purchase no matter costs
I can say a whole lot without even having to talk

Blind shades, brighter days, you know what you mean to me
Darker hues, I feel used
I don't know what you see in me
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop
I thought I told you that we won't stop

Carhartt cover my heart (Heart)

Your crew they just bark (Bark)
You wanna be on the charts? (Uh)
I just wanna be where it's dark (Yeah)
Bitch better play your part (Part)
I will hang you like art
Every morning, you cry (Cry)
Every single night, I die (Die)
Let's get down to the bottom line
Your whole existence is a lie (Lie)
Noose around my neck, goodbye (Bye)
Yo bitch want what I supply
You mad at me? What a surprise
When Bones talk, bitch be quiet (Shut up)
Talking ‘bout some smoke, know I need all of that (All of that)
Bitchin bout you broke
Bitch get off your ass and do something nasty
Acting like a hoe, so I'm gon' treat you like one
Double cross me, I will break your ankle just like AND-1

VVS overbite, I roll the dice
Thinking about a corporate life, froze like the coldest night
Looking out of the world from a ledge hoping like
Maybe if I smoke myself to death, I won't be so precise, so pristine
Used to paying for a open mic
BONES killed the microphone, you, you just hold the mic
Pimp like Dolemite, high like dragonite
Me against the world, results that show they ain't half as nice
A creature of habit, you keep on the Pateks
I don't need a clock to tell me when to bring you the static
I'ma pressed juice addict, got the jars in the attic
Don't act like you get down when you ain't even heard of Cracker
I hope you got a backup, plan b or something
'Cause when I go and get to bussin'
You'll be gone somewhere recovering
Too cash, I'm hovering
Women they be loving it
TeamSESH stamped in their brain, steady buffering
What, BONES, Sesh, Dead-Boy, what

The thing that hurts the most, I know when I'm too stubborn
To even see your son, cause I don't want to see his mother
Thinking about what she did to you, I'm filled with hate
Wish that I could take away your pain but it's too late
Now I only see your face in the dreams that I have
Every night I go to sleep, I hope it happens again
It's funny 'cause you were 20, I pictured you as a kid
Around the time we first met, it was like seven or six
Made me cry like a bitch, even writing this shit
Didn't even know you did drugs, maybe you were embarrassed by it
Or maybe the distance between us physically kept me out of it
But it kills me to know it took other people to even hear about it
I know, you didn't mean for this to happen
Yeah I know, all you wanted to be was happy
Yeah I know, you didn't mean for this to happen
Yeah I know, all you wanted to be was happy, what
#
Bad motherfucker with a bad attitude
Flow like trash in a pool
Never would I do what you ask me to do
'Cause you do what you want when you got nothing to prove
And when you got nothing to lose
You would do what it takes just to get money for food
That's how I used to feel, that's way too real
Almost gives me chills
Back to the motherfucking plan at hand
Gun to my server act hard, get banned
Look how many rappers are holy like sand
Castle on the hill with the place I stand
Throne made of gold, silk gloves on my hands
I don't touch peasants and I don't do grams
No more loss for your pussy it's true
I done broke my back just to get it how I do
TV static, blunt wrap addict
Coming, boutta cut your throat, while I'm at it
We make classics, SESH make racket
I can hear when you rap, you ain't got passion

Bitch, get out my way (way)
Bitch, get out my face (face)
You don't wanna talk about it
You just wanna fuck about it
Got a grave you can lay (what)

Going back to the old me
Some call me the OG, I just tell em “Oh, please”
This is just what I got to do to keep sane
This is what I got to do for my brain
Flowing's what I gotta do to maintain
Fuck what they claim, fuck what they say
Imma bring it back to the grave, bang
#
Your heart fell right into my lap
Your voice downloaded to my head
Before you I never felt like that
For you, I will pack my bags
Say goodbye to this life I know
If it means that you'd be okay
When you're gone, it stunts my growth
Next to you is my favorite place

Wide awake
I'm wide awake, thinking about you
Watch you sleep, while I'm laying beside you
Wide awake, thinking about you
How do you do this to me?
I’m wide awake, thinking about you
Watch you sleep, while I'm laying beside you
Wide awake, thinking about you
How do you do this to me now?

Range rovers, layovers
I switch lanes on a motherfucker, oh

The place that I grew up was hard to leave
It had everything I loved and hated and in-between
Had visions and intuitions of a west coast theme
But we were smoking synthetic
When I slept, I couldn't dream
So how I'm supposed to see what I know I truly mean
When my eyes are glazed over and my brain can't breathe
When Jane and El left to show me a couple of things
Like you ain't gotta settle with the metal this town breeds
But how do I dash and carve out my own path
When I don't see no problem with livin’ and sleepin’ in trash
It was the highlight of our year to get a quarter ounce back
Finally we had something to release the anger we had
But just as all things do, it started to get old
Everyday on rewind, I played the same old role
Had a chip on my shoulder, almost to the point I would scold
Anyone of my old friends that told me stay home
'Cause they didn't get it and I got that they never would
Don't want to die in a place where the graves are made of mud
What
SESH

Gotta do, what I got to do, gotta do, what I got to do
Gotta do, what I got to do, gotta do, what I got to do

Silence creeps, the violence speaks, I let the
Violin sing so violently I got to
Finally see my dreams will fight for me
Nightmares calling out to me
Smoke, watch the time pass, cash sign eyelids
Gold on my boots, razor blade tucked inside it
Smoke, watch the time pass, cash sign eyelids
Gold on my boots, razor blade tucked inside it

Caring 'bout your money, that's the hardest thing

Virus

Screaming "Fuck the World!"
Over it, for sure
Bitch, I do not want to hear it (Hear it)
Feelings that occur in me every day
I can no longer conceal it ('Ceal it)
Razor in my mouth, rage inside my heart
They be so sick I can't feel it (Feel it)
Burning down your life, spells that I recite
I am the witch that you're fearing, bitch
AK banging, now you can't hear shit
Cut off your limbs, now you can't do shit
White glove killer, you can't prove it
Knock you off 'cause I'm on my shit
Chop you up, put you in the woods
I am what I always knew I was
White motherfucker, from the pipe motherfucker
Goodnight motherfucker, sweet dreams
Bitch
Looking at my life, I'm so fed up
Foot on your throat, BONES don't let up
Slipping and falling, you can't get up
She tell you, "No”, but she gon' let us
Drop you to the ground, let me see what you got
Talking all that shit, okay I'm finna see what you're not
Jamming like a Hi-Point, cut through and burn up your spot
Look me in my eyes, boy you see a corpse that is rotten
Try your best but can't stop it
Slam that blade like a locker
Got no need for no chopper
Got a million razors, that's options
What

All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

SESH

Punk motherfuckers, duck motherfuckers
Play with BONES, and I promise you'll get fucked motherfuckers
I’ll put you on something, I don't fuck with no suckers
Kick rap, smoke dope, then I ride like buster
I'm the motherfucking Scumbag, never forget
I’m comprised of bad days, and subtle regrets
I got the hand on the TEC, and the clip and the 9
Say another word like Pinky, get popped you're a clown
I lay yo ass back, just like a La-Z-Boy
Too much woods been smoked, still hazy boy
White paint, black seats, old fashion my rover
Red rover, red rover, call your bitch on over
Used to want a Benz G, with the flags like H.O.V.A
'Til I turned a certain age, and saw he popped like soda
So out of tune with what's cool, like just a old man
But I'm still magic somehow, poof, Alakazam

All metal my spot, then honeycomb my base
The rifle off safety just to ensure I'm safe
I will bang
All your boys give a fuck, what you claim
It's TeamSESH 'til I lay
What

Feeling something like Black Dynamite
But I’m white like lightning, when it finally strikes
I crack road, smash homes and break the foundation
I was high for so long, I’m on a permanent vacation
Had dope in my nails, burn marks on the floor
Got skeleton soldiers, if you want to go to war
Heard your shit one time, to say the least I was bored
You act tough on the surface, but you're soft to the core
SESH
#
‘Twas a dark night, much darker than others
BONES at your door, I bet you hide under covers
Fuck the other side, only ride with my brothers
When the snow on the streets, we be deep in the jungle
We bring the hurt
I'm from the dirt
Still I rise every morning like let me get to work
Fuck what you heard
Fuck who you talkin’ to
I will see you one day, and when I do you'll be barbecue
Never had shit to prove
You talking like we cool
We ain't from the same block, I’m from a different school
Could never fear the weak, it's time to face the king
These boots ain't made for walking, they're for breaking teeth
SESH
#
I swore on everything, I would never let you fall
So when you died, I did too
A part of me left that day in June
A couple months later, got that call I was dreading
I couldn’t sleep a wink

We were just about to get you a ticket, get you out of that town
Who would’ve thought that this would happen right now?
Your son looks just like you
It’s hard for me to compute
You said we would see this through
When it was just me and you
First time I saw your mother after that
She gave me your ashes in a small gold necklace
#
Looking like the Bogeyman, all black hoodie man
Lurking in the motherfucking darkness
Always wanna get it man, shit ain’t all goodie, man
Matter a fact, it's far from it
Straight up out the morgue, pale white corpse
Your bitch hooked to me like phonics
I tend to be where it's darkened
Sunlight, I wish I could stop it
Drop down to the earth like a comet
We solid, we rock like onyx
Life is a lie, to be honest
There's a reason I tend to be violent
I been, coping with the fact I'm here
Everyday is a new nightmare
Life is a bitch, she don't fight fair
Sometimes I despise the concept of air

Please, put me in a choke hold
I don't wish to be here no more
Please, put me in a choke hold
I wanna go and never come home
#
When the lights went dim, I slipped and fell
Who do I have the pleasure
Of this knuckle sandwich I prepared well
Strictly out of aggression
I'm not trying to hurt you bad
Say uncle if it gets too rough
Like a needle that needs new thread
I’m saying I'm running out of excuses
I'm far more than useless to you

I am so useless to you
Far more than useless to you
Like a nomad that wields no better
I guess I’m pulling an all-nighter
Walking in the dark with spiders tonight

If I ever need you
Ever need you
Running tonight
If I ever need you
Ever need you
Running tonight

You’re tearing us apart, Blanco

Eiffel 65, baby I'm blue
Had a dream, that I woke up in my tomb
And I was happy, like for once, I wasn't doomed
Then I came to, and knew it wasn't true
Don't look at me no I do not fuck with you
Keep that tool, up in my fruit wheres the loot
Like Lil O, back back, give me room
In this rat race, I would rather lose
Than be like you, than be like you
I would take my life, if I woke up in your shoes
How do you do it? It's so upsetting
Thinking these materials you acquire make you better
What

Eiffel 65, baby I'm azul
I don't know how to crush, still that fresh pressed juice
Knock him off, and give SESH the best news
You wouldn't believe what happened even if I told you
There was blood up on the floor, there was mud up on my boots
Took a trek through the woods, just to show 'em how we do
We too deep, when we move
PP3 coming soon
Red dot, like I'm recording
Aim it at you, then I zoom
Freeze frame your life
Wish you could rewind
Eject you from the game, we just living to die
Bloodshot my eyes, I tell no lies
The day I go, stay tuned and watch the dead man rise
SESH
#
I’m hardly impressed, and rarely surprised
I’m 24 years of age but I feel like 45
I’ve seen the other guys, I done peeped the other side
There’s not a day of the week that I relate to their rhymes
The way they not embarrassed, depressed deep down inside
Turn themselves into a cartoon in hopes it will suffice
Gold-plated bronze, imitation ice
Tryna fake it but they end up breaking out for this life
They throw it all away, everything that came naturally
Every aspect that is unique, they done trashed it
Ridiculous outfits, unfitting haircuts
The opposite of them just as long as it means bucks
Pseudo rap enthusiasts belong in the loony bin
On the internet trying to prove to strangers how cool he is
I’m no gatekeeper for what you should and shouldn’t do
But look inside of you, I promise you will know just what to do
SESH
Yeah, BONES
What, what, what

I done put a hundred thousand hours into this shit
Made a hundred songs before I turned the age of 10
Don’t talk to me about how you feel old
'Cause I've spent some years on this
Bitch, get out my zone
This road I walk alone is cold but I am Bones
Ten toes when they would fold so many nights alone
The roar from the crowd when I break a microphone
The lure of the dead man has took me 'round the globe
The team that is SESH forever etches stone for those that follow in our steps to make their own
We the main ingredients, whatever's on the stove
You could be hot now, but tomorrow you gon’ be cold
#
Fuck do you mean you been gettin' it
Little boy, you must be kiddin' me
Broke bitch, you the epitome
Saw your bitch page and she pinnin' me
SESH never run out of energy
BONES never run out of enemies
Talkin' that no don't offend me
Money that's only that makin' me
I gotta dash
I gotta go
Water my neck overflowin'
You got a check, you got a tour
But your label still you be owin' em
I could go on
Need I say more?
You're insecure and you're showin' it
You should invest it
You should be savin'
But it's that I see you blowin' it
Out to the truck
Weed in the blunt
When you on SESH, you do what you want
Don't give a fuck
Your boy is a bum
His music is shit and his house is a dump
Load up them guns
Run and come find me
I'm in the house with the pool behind it
Multiple rooms it's a task to find me

Ice Watch
I got a bitch from the sticks (Sticks)
She cook the shrimp with the grits (Grits)
You niggas brag about steaks (Steaks)
I feed that shit to my pits (Assholes)
Might take a flight to an Island (Island)
You might carpool in a Lyft
These bottles a thousand a sip (Sip)
Smell like money take a whiff
Weed and shit you can't get (Get)
Pufferfish with the asparagus (Asparagus)
Been that nigga for a long time (Long time)
All my merch, your bitch's wearin' it (Wearin' it)
Ice Watch you hilarious (Hilarious)
Debonair and nefarious (Nefarious)
Must I remind you that I been that nigga
Okay I been that nigga for a long time
Your bitch know all my song titles (Song titles)
Album links and song times (Song times)
She only bump you sometimes (Sometimes)

Wait a minute
What's that about?

Why you gotta do me like that?
My face in my hands, you got me down bad
Why you gotta do me like that?
Tracin' my steps trynna see what I did, but I know I ain't do shit to deserve this

Now that you got me
In your pocket
You trynna call the shots but bitch no please just stop it
Never find one like me
These boys they carbon copies
They look like Denis Rodman, way back in the 1990s
I got that loot, come rob me
Like Jenga, stack your bodies
No, BONES don't like nobody
Smoke dope, go ghost, I'm out of here
Kicking raps is the hobby
We cash up in the lobby
We only here for 24 hours, I'm tryna see what's poppin'
City lights they shinin'
The budget just keep climbin'
Boy you need to sell them diamonds I notice your numbers droppin'
To me that don't mean nothin'
But to you it's everything
Better round up cars, chains, clothes and the fancy diamond rings

Why you gotta do me like that?
My face in my hands, you got me down bad
Why you gotta do me like that?
Tracin' my steps trynna see what I did, but I know I ain't do shit to deserve this

I'm down for whatever you want
I'm down for whatever you need
You know me, I know you
Tell me, what's the difference?

Fall apart, go back to sleep
Wake up, repeat it all again tomorrow
Try my best to go save you
But if you don't want to be saved
You don't want to be saved
From another planet right now
Shine like solar panels

Hello, hello, are you hearing me?
Hello, hello, are you hearing me?
Hello, hello

Talking to myself like therapy
Looking in the mirror I barely see
Nothing but someone that truly was something else but
No, no, no, don't be scared of me
Trapped here, anywhere
It is too far to go, yeah
Trapped here, anywhere
It is too far to go, yeah

It's hard to find  my sense of life
When I'm without you
Can’t imagine going on without you
It's hard to find my sense of life
When I'm without you
Can’t imagine going on without you
I get mad, I get sad
Baby, I'm want it all
When I'm down, when I frown
Baby, I want it all
I guess I'll see, I gotta dip
Baby, I'm for it all
Life is a trip
Sometimes I think
I gotta go give it up

I'm down for whatever you want
I'm down for whatever you need
You know me, I know you
Tell me, what's the difference?

I am the snow on the road (road)
I make it hard to get home (home)
I am the wind when it blows (blows)
I am the reason you cold (cold)
You are the one on my mind (mind)
You are the mountain I climb (climb)
You are the one on my line (line)
When I pick up my phone (phone)
Nothing in my heart but you, you're the reason I can move
It’s like you cut the limbs off of everyone cause no one touching you
There is nothing I can do, you are taking over me
But I love it, you the only one I trust besides the team
I would cover the streets in leaves, shake the trees and make a scene
If you want an idol, I will look up and tell the clouds to leave
Give you sun, I'll give you my
Full attention all the time
Til' the end of life
You’re the only one I call mine

You
And it be like that, til' the sky go black and my line on flat
You
And it be like that, til' the sky go black and my line on flat
What?

How do you feel today
I hope that it's better
Than yesterday, no I hate seeing you down
I know that we both said some things that we regretted
Really wish I could say I never made you frown

You were right all along
I was just selfish
Anytime I needed you, you'd be right there
How do you do these things you do?
Couldn't put up with me if I were you, I were you

Looking back on how I'm acting
Ask myself "Why did I do it like that?"
I gotta change for the better
Embody all this sunny weather
Tryna go back is like tryna stop the rain
You know I cannot do that
Forever, I'm cold like December
I wish it was hard to remember

That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it moves
That's just the way it goes
That's just the way it moves
#
Precipitation, reflections on the pavement
Try your best not to look down,  or you'll you have to face it
The truth comes when you least expect it to grace you
So graciously I stand out in the storm with nature
Life will try to taint you, modify your perspective
It will do everything that it can to be hectic
Check this
Time is a currency I invest in
Water in my right, switchblade up in my left hand
Minutes fly by without even having to notice
I was due too, without even choosing to focus
I can sleep all day and wake up to the moon
Or I can wake with the birds and get straight to the doom
Used to be hopeless
Some days, still feel like it
But truth be told, if life is a party I'm just arriving
I ain't had to struggle in a couple of years
Can feed my family and keep a roof over they heads
Yeah

I just can't fuck with y'all, man
I could never give a fuck what y'all say
I just can't fuck with y'all, man
I could never give a fuck what y'all say

Wait
Like El DeBarge
Shock, can't get enough
Work is never hard when you lovin' just where you are
IPA spilling on my Hanes extra large
When I get to kickin' raps and waving my arms
I'm in this 'till i'm gone
I'm innocent 'till I'm charged
I murder with zero alibis ready to tell the judge
I let you lay in mud
You leave me covered in blood
That's a fair trade as just as long as the deed is done
Yuh

Bones

Dead boys
Ye, ye, yuh

Sometimes I get emotional
I gotta let it cry out, gotta let it cry out
Sometimes I get down bad
But I keep it to myself oh, keep it to myself oh
I go where nobody bothers to
I long to be where nobody bothers you

Put good in, get good out
That's what I always heard it's about
As of lately I highly doubt
That's true cause we living in a drought
People hungry, babies starving
That alone should truly alarm us
The human condition
It's like we don't care unless it to, or about us
I'm done with it
I love quitting
My cooldown's done in 30 minutes
Let me start all over again
The cycle it starts with birth and ends with death

Sometimes I get emotional
I gotta let it cry out, gotta let it cry out
Sometimes I get down bad
But I keep it to myself oh, keep it to myself oh
I go where nobody bothers to
I long to be where nobody bothers you

I told you I would get it right, and what do I do?
I go and fuck it up just like I always do
I told you I would get it right
I told you I would finally get things right, but no

Go and rob me, I’ma know what you gonna do
Why don't I give a fuck now?
Throw me away, put my body to shame
Give a fuck 'bout none of your bustdowns
Fuck what you wanna do
And fuck who you kickin' with
Fuck what you goin' through
Mother fuck what you dealin' with

Mentally, I’m by myself
Doomed to face the world with no one else
Mentally, by myself
Doomed to face the world, no one else, no

I told you I would get it right and what do I do
I go and fuck it up just like I always do
I told you I would get it right
I told you I would finally get things right, but no

I just want to get away now
Find somewhere quiet, then lay down
I'm gettin' sick of just waitin' around
Done with you, you only play round
Never do shit, you just say now
I feel like I’m just hangin' around
#
All you "What have you done for me lately?" ass motherfuckers
Better duck when I buck
Finna blast y'all suckers off
You can try 'til you never can get it, no motherfuckers
Do everything that you can but they'll never be pleased, never
There's always something new
That they want out of you

Used to ride in a Corolla down a road made of mud
Now we sitting on the bus with the buck skin rug
Always expecting the worst so I only feel luck
Got my brothers by my side and my blade's still tucked
Blade still tucked in my overcoat, tucked in my overcoat
(Tucked in my overcoat)
Try to come between us and your face getting fucked
I remember days that I needed to be numb
Now I wanna feel every second when I'm on
Now I wanna feel every second when I'm on
#
As I roved out on a bright May morning
To view the meadows and flowers gay
Whom should I spy but my own true lover
As she sat under yon willow tree
I took off my hat and I did salute her
I did salute her most courageously
When she turned around, well, the tears fell from her
Sayin' "False young man, you have deluded me
A diamond ring I owned, I gave you
A diamond ring to wear on your right hand
But the vows you made, love, you went and broke them
And married the lassie that had the land"
#
That's where you’ll find me
That's where you'll find me
That’s where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
#
Change all the locks and move the furniture all around
Paint the room with a different shade pull all the blinds down
I wanna barely recognize this place that I call home
The world steady turning at a different pace I can't follow

I just want to feel alive
Shiver down my spine I want wind in my eyes
Blood on my skin let it shine in the light
Reaper on my side I don't ever gotta die

I'm all in thats forever you are in
No I'd rather death is slow, life is faster
Yes I know a new chapter if I told you I'm after you, that means I'm the latter
I hope I follow up on all these things
I hope I'm holding up to the standards you set
Then again you have always been

Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been
Then again you have always been

Blunts got me stuck can't move
Too many times I played the fool
I like the way the light hit my jewels
Bumping unreleased shit in unreleased shoes
White devil watch me give the world the blues
Analyze my ways watch every move
Never bang then tell us just how you do
They never change same through and through

In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up

SESH
Patek on your arm like its hard work
Blade against your face do your blood work
Motherfuck your crew do you all dirt
100 to the face now I'm okay
Think you something special bitch no way
The day you see my face thats a cold case
Diamonds dripping wet now I'm soaking
Don't gotta say my name because they know me

In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
In the dead of the night my flaws always wake me up
You say that you're alright, I hope you're not making it up
#
When I feel low, I never want to tell a soul, oh no
This might not be the best for me
You be the judge, I'll be the contestant
Tell me what you think
I’m all ears, I'm all in, I'm always listening

Skaleaton

I didn't really want you to fall like that
Didn't really have time to take it back
And I was trying really hard to punish him
I didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that
I don't really want anyone else to feel like that
All I wanted was somebody to light the path
Didn't really matter what I wanted
Didn't really matter what I wanted

I know we can talk it out, but I don't want to
I am me, you are you, do what you want to
I know that sorry's are never enough to
Mend what I did, but it only feels right to
I am on a ride that I asked to be on
The point of no return's behind too far gone
I can never hide all this fear in my heart
So I will start by telling you I was wrong

You didn't know, oh, oh
You didn't know, oh, oh

I didn't really want you to fall like that
Didn't really have time to take it back
And I was trying really hard to punish him
I didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that, didn't know that
I don't really want anyone else to feel like that
All I wanted was somebody to light the path
Didn't really matter what I wanted
Didn't really matter what I wanted

Spacedtime
What, what, what, what
SESH, SESH, SESH, SESH, Bones

Don't act like I give a fuck
Actin like you different but
Ain't got shit but shitty luck
Ridin' in that shitty truck
Four by four I lift it up
Dare you to come bitch at us
Raise your voice like "listen up"
But TeamSESH sure ain't listenin'
Made a couple Ms I could use a couple more
Show the world a sound they ain't never heard before
I done shared my brain signals with the ones that don't
Ones that couldn't make it up themselves copy Bones
Rented flows, that's a loan
I put interest on 'em though
What they can't come up with in respect I'll have to take in blood
Out the mud, how I got it
Buckets how I shot it
Sesh is something that you not
So like, tag you not it
Melodies got em nodding
8-ball corner pocket
Never scratch, never that
Slaughtered every project
Every place you walking
Just know I'm somewhere watching
The wind that hit the trees
I am the flowers plus the pollen

SESH
#
My brain's betrayed me and my heart’s fallen numb
My body shuts down, is it really all that simple to try and walk

Better safe than sorry, I remain seated throughout the night
Leave me broken, just go on, I won't tell you to hold on
Leave me broken, just go on, I won't tell you to hold on

I love you more than I love myself
Oh, oh, I will wait for you
Oh, oh, I will wait
Oh, oh, I will wait for you
Oh, oh, I will wait
#
Even though I'm striving for the spotlight
Always find me hiding in the night life
Even though it's overdue, it's high time
Keep on going under, need some downtime

Can't take
These lights
Shining on my life
Can't take
These lights
Shining on my life

I don't wanna talk if you can't tell
Nothing I love more than hate mail
Step up to SESH and I bring you to hell
I was raised by JNL
Cutting them off like a hangnail
Razor on my hip
If you ain't one of us, we can tell
You ain't gotta say shit
Two dead bodies one gas tank
Zero regrets for the past
One match strike and a burnt Ford
That's how the legend of Bones was born
#
Before the sun rise I am
Already up and at 'em it’s the corpse with a plan
Manual labor I got the world in my hands
They see me out in public hit me with the audible glance
Two left legs, do not invite me to dance
'Cuz I will cut the rug up and go rob your advance
Y'all so typical with your obvious rants
Me I stay unorthodox that’s how I enhance
The life I'm livin' now wasn't possible then
Still I picked my little dreams up took 'em and ran
Small town too small for me to advance
Took 'em to the extreme I saw the limit and passed
Now I'm on the dash runnin' away from my past
From a place where nobody pitched in for the gas
No words of encouragement had to give ’em to myself
Talkin’ in the mirror like you'll have to do it yourself
When I did, cold shoulders got so frozen
MisterTenBelow drop ’em all in the ocean
Change my phone number so now they all holdin'
I knew they'd come around pussies always foldin'
Askin’ how I did it hit 'em with the "I don't know" shit
Everybody has their preconceived notions
'bout the dead man 'fore words are even spoken
Hopeless, don't involve me in your showbiz, bitch

Who do it better I'm fed up I got the medicine
For those seekin', asylum I'm bout to let you in
Dropped out at 15, what the fuck's a letterman?
Do not ask me shit about graduation day
I just do this shit that you see when dreams flashin'
At the international terminal checkin' bags in
Long flight to Moscow, wake me when we land
Shit, my lady, my brother, 14 hours and then we landin'
Spasibo to the real fans, just know you got me this far
I short circuit press to talk, just like a discord
I'm a flashdrive with a hundred billion terabytes
Never runnin' out of shit that's why they runnin' for their life
Lights out for any competition, though
Yet to see one, though, within my peripheral
Hold on, here we go, send 'em off, cheerio
Good day, chaps and now relax I am imperial
Feet up just like a king should
Who the fuck else done as much as I done?
"Lord Bones, do you ever take a break?"
Every day's a vacation, where you become the wave

What?
SESH, Bones

Flip money like flipper
Drunk off of liquor
Hitech in my cup, dog, I'm a big sipper
Hand on the trigger
Now I’m a killer
Hand full of x-
I'm the drug dealer
Filler, clip full of bullets to your liver
Stick a tre in your face for my dinner
Winner, 'cause I got bags on me now
Every show a hunnit thou
Man, I’m the cash cow
Used to rob for a living
Pullin' them pistols out
I just got out of prison
They wondering how
A minority getting majority of cash
Baby momma in my ear
I'm ignoring her ass

Drop back, cop that
Got the key to the game I'mma lock that
Fall back
Talk that shit if you want just know that I will pop back
Man down, try to step up but you laying down
Hands bound, tied like a hog no one cares now
Fuck that buck back if you're really down
Your crew ain't no shit
Sympathetic to the core, bitch
Got some but I want more, bitch
Wanna fight, then that's war, bitch
SESH bring you to your knees better say please
If you really wanna see your life evolve then convince me
Turn you to minced meat, you will regret meeting me
I'm nothing like you think when you see me on the fucking screen

Sesh
Nothing like you think when you see me on the fucking screen

Sesh
I remain the god of the underground
Everlasting corpse I go a hundred rounds
Step up and I will glitch you out of bounds
On mute, I will get you without a sound
Yeah you got a hundred chains but ain't got a crown
We all know what it say on your bustdown
Drip drip bling blou, okay what now?
That ain't gon' help when the dark devour
You and yours blackout on your team
Clap on clap off when we face to face, bitch
All bets off, if you reach for us you get your arms clipped off (What)
Like a knife through butter
You are just a meal that barely quench the hunger (Fuck)
I don't know why I love it
Probably 'cause I know what you did like it's last summer
I'm the shadow in the rafters, metal on drywall
Listen to the scratching (Bones)
Bones never been passive
If I get agitated I will end your passion (Yeah)
Notice I ain't say career
I can't give em too much credit if they started last year (No)
You're too new to shit and that includes you, bitch
You act too big for your britches, get neutered bitch
I ain't confused, no this shit ain't Clue you bitch
I will flip my faces like Guess Who and shit
They wanna be me, that's some big shoes to fit
You boys need an Oscar
Act but can't rap, you a whole imposter
You ain't scary, you a creepypasta
And me I ain't human I'm a real life monster

Fuck who you kick it with, I come all alone
Pull up at your home, put that razor to your dome
Fuck who you kick it with, I come all alone
Pull up at your home, put that razor to your dome
#
Open the pack is it good enough, I don't know, I don't know, wait
Soon as I look at the gar, I know if we going far
If it seem we only got one, we gotta hop in the car
Rollin', red lights, killing roaches in the moonlight
Stay down, lay down, I will never go
I will make sure you are never cold
You wanna bust out that AP
You want a millie the first week
You gotta go harder than that
Riding in the hearse all black
I just wanna tell it how it is
I just wanna tell it how it is

Tomorrow seems so far away
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait
Tomorrow seems so far away
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna wait

What? What?

Привет, bitch, как дела?
Tell the reaper, hurry up, like arriba
The Terminator of the game, like "I'll be back"
I did whatever it took to, never a 9 to 5
No, don't you lie, no, don't you cry
Light the fuse and I'll blow like the 4th of July
You will comply, or I will supply your life
With such pain that is hard to describe
I am hard to define I'm rather off in design
Hate life to the point there ain't shit I desire
Said you'd pull up on me
But you've yet to come by
Injected with lies, infected with rhymes
What is it that you do, come and please remind
I'm the type of machine that put you in rewind
Bring you back to the very first time
You have ever felt fear running down your spine

Bitch, don't say shit
Right click, save it
I gotta Vanquish
Hope you think I ain't shit
Bitch, don't say shit
Right click, save it
I gotta vanquish
Hope you think I ain't shit

I want you so bad, even though it still hurts
Holdin' me hostage, using those words
They taste like poison
It's venom in your voice, yeah yeah
I want you so bad even though you no good
Holdin' out hope when I know that I shouldn't
Just like poison
There's venom in your voice, yeah yeah

Pullin' up, poppin' out all in one motion
I know how you really feel it ain't no notion
I'm hoping you know that I'd kill, for you
Whatever you want that's whatever you need know I will, for you
I never go, forever more
Sometimes I get up and feel alone

I know you can wait for eventually
But you don't have to
Fall back I'm the one that'll back you
I'm the one that night looking at you
No matter what I do there's no getting back you

I want you so bad, even though it still hurts
Holdin' me hostage, using those words
They taste like poison
It's venom in your voice, yeah yeah
I want you so bad even though you no good
Holdin' out hope when I know that I shouldn't
Just like poison
There's venom in your voice, yeah yeah

Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm

Diamonds on my wrist, oh
Diamonds on my neck too, oh
Yes I can watch them glisten
But none of that gon' mean shit when
I'm down, down, lower than low
Money ain't shit when you're six feet low
Baby that's just the truth about it
There's no way around it

Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm
Going through the motions, I
Be caught up in emotions, I'm
Going through the motions, I'm
Too fast can't hold on, I'm

People I never talk to
Turn and they say I'm awful
They don't even know me
Fuck you
Put it on everything I love
Family, my lady, my team, and no
They can never figure us out too
Count it up
Count it all
Count it up
Count it all
Mount it up
Mount it up
Mount it up
Mount it up
#
I just want you to be okay
But I know that I am not magic
Emotions do what they have to
Sometimes, I wish that wasn't real
I hope I learn to feel, one day some way, one day some way
I don't mean to be that way with you
You're my only exclusion
Sorry for the confusion
I know I'm not easy to love
Not easy to love
So sorry for what I've done
Every night that you sleep, I hope that I'm in your dreams
Every morning I wake, you are the first one that I see

I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever
I wanna feel it forever

This game ain't for me
My reflection aim for me
My only competition's me, saw myself above it
I stay up late working
My lady wait up for me
You do it for a check, like where the waiter, hurry
I do it for my life, it's the only place I flourish
I'm aiming at your loved ones if you run up on me
TeamSESH an army
You never harming nothing
Stick to the books kid, go to Harvard something
Bones a farmer man, now watch me harvest something
No script you better stick to yours like drama something
That money came quick, almost too fast
While you struggling with the weight like slim fast
Bitch

Twenty-eight karats, thirty pointers in the hit
Princess cuts I swear I damn near cut my wrists
Never had shit so I'm not used to having this
Trying to make an angle boy you need to get a grip
Banana peel blunts, mess up you gon’ slip
You only kill once, now you king of clips
[?] running like Glock locked up on your hip
They knock you down like doors, surprised that you can afford
The longer I've been here for
I'm worse off than I thought, I prefer the room all dark
Your upbringing is sweet, your whole style is neat
I’m happy you've never seen your friends leave in their sleep
It's tragic, the hill is steep
In line with bad dreams
I flash back to rags getting soaked in the sink
The price of copper's down last time I checked
I know it's hard times for the rats in the midwest
What?

New watch doing backflips like gymnastics
Three shots like a hat trick, that's the goal, hoe
Told me she don't need me
Told that bitch to leave me
Kicked her out for talkin 'cause that bitch was too needy
I ain’t sharing nothing but a bullet
Doing dirt like Joe plus I put two up in your mullet
You can try me like you think I wouldn’t do it
Guess again, leave you blowing in the wind when I pull it
Diamonds falling out my cheeks, fell asleep in diamond sheets
Tuck a rich nigga in, making money in my sleep
I'mma probably rob a nigga I don’t even need that shit
I do it for adrenaline, take that shit and leave that shit
Frankly you can have that hoe, 'cause I don't even need that bitch
Different whips every day, can't even believe this shit
I can’t even believe this shit
Different whips every day, I can't even believe this shit
Catch me at your local Target looking like a target
All this ice up on my wrist I harvest like a farmer
Thought I went to Harvard, thought I was a pharmacist
The way I stay with drugs, like I can't even call it quits
Used to run up in the stores lookin for a handout
Now I step up in and buy it all 'cause I'm the man now
Didn't know 'em last year, now these niggas fam now
Took some Ls last year, so I changed the plan now
I don't think these niggas understand (understand)
I don't think these niggas understand that I'm the man now
I don't think these niggas understand
I don't think these niggas understand I'm in demand now

Oh brother you've helped me, in more ways than one
I wish I could speak the words
To tell you what you've done
For my life, for my life, for my life
And for you I will bring the moon down from the sky, from the sky
Right where you came from, an angel in disguise
Brother, brother, you have never turned
I could never learn how to be like you, be like you
You are everything I could ever dream to be
Dream to be, dream to be, dream to be

Wake me before you go
Wait for me, just wait for me
Wake me before you go
Wait for me, just wait for me

It's the IRL Nightmare, wake up I’ll be right there
Find me at the top while you remain the hype man
Alrighty then, Ace Ventura how they bite me
20k for flight fare, to me that's just a light day
Sitting in the cockpit, pilot Bones reporting in
I land with ease while recording this at 4 AM
A microphone, that's all I really need
And whatever the team want, just put it on me
See, I bring home the bread and the butter
I focus on creating while you focused on stunting
So go out to the parties and wonder why you got nothing
I’mma stay home making these records until the sun up
That's the Sesh way, I could never change
Never see me at the club trying to be seen
You can run that scene, you can throw that green
I'mma lock my doors, I'mma never ever leave
Yeah you got ice, nowadays who doesn't
Then again, yours lookin cloudy like it be stormin
Talking low grade stones with some piss poor clarity
I feel like I'm so ahead, it's almost not fair to be me
Papa Bones, tell us how it work
First they sign a shitty deal, then they get hurt
But they can't show it so they grab money and blow it
Everybody make me cringe and I don’t think that will be slowin
Anytime, so feel the temperature in the room
Change like the seasons, turn your block into a tomb
Bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom
Bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom, bitch kaboom

What?

Load it and shoot you like b.g_i
Diamond different colors like Fiji skies
Blade always hiding like he's too shy
You lookin like you’d be pleased to die
Tell me the truth, when I look at you
I take your soul, I don't want your loot
I need to go, I gotta bail
Don't know why you scared but you feel it like braille
Stop, drop, and roll, the flame is my attire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
Cold bottle, hot steel, put that shit together
Dump the beer on the razor, now it’s IPA infection
I won't hate bitch fuck affection, you not allowed up in my section
I first guess, I never second
I know who's there no need for checkin'
When I got on it was "fuck 'em all"
When I got rollin' it was "crush 'em all"
You take deals, you pop pills, you bow down, I never will
Never feel sympathetic for you pussies tryna get it
We up in it, we all did it, it's up to you to get it correctly
You like Bentleys, I like trucks, got this game bottled up
Condensation, got ’em hatin’ 'cause they views ain’t adding up
I never wanted that, bitch I just wanted to rap
While the rest want pixels on the screen converting to likes that's a fact
I'm the bat in the night, flying high above the lights
Fuck you plebs, I'll be SESH to the night I fuckin die

You can see it, you can see it in my eyes, oh
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes (In my eyes)
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes, oh
You can see it, you can see it in my eyes
Roll up, hold up, sold out shows
Hold up, I don't know anymore
If I got a problem, you know who solve it
Either the blade or revolver
Load up six times, say your goodbyes

Worst case scenario, I'll be gone
Worst case scenario, falling apart
Worst case scenario, I'll be gone
Worst case scenario

It's all my fault
I'm the result of caring much less than ever before
For what it's worth, I'm in a rut
To dwell on the impact I made on this world
Terrible, to the core I'm rotten
There I go once again with my problems
I don't wish this on my worst fuckin' enemies
I'm in disbelief anybody is befriending me
But they don't know how bad it gets
They see me on good days, never on bad
Shine like baguettes, VVS neck
You can see my insecurities from a jet
Anyone with eyes can see my regrets
If you're down to listen, I'ma get it off my chest
I don't think I got that much time
#
Sicker than me, doubt that (Doubt that)
Grippin' that heat, huh fall back (Fall back)
Say that you fuck and don't call back (Call back)
You full of shit need to drop that (Drop that)
Sicker than me, doubt that  (Doubt that)
Grippin' that heat, I'll fall back (Fall back)
Say that you fuck and don't call back (Call back)
You full of shit need to drop that (Drop that)

Slappin' the clip in the MP
40 I rip till it's empty
24 feelin' like 43
Did 10 years of work but in 1 week
Built for the dirt like a Humvee
Used to the hurt like it nothing
Acting like you be on something
Key word is acting, you bluffing
Cut, what
Take you a year only take me a month
Stop, drop
Set fire to your life watch your ass go up
Shine, glisten
Diamonds they spoiled they always be bitchin'
I never fit in
Came down so hard I created a fissure
#
Anytime I play, it's you that your bitch ignoring
Looking like I stabbed Haley Joel Osment in Pay It Forward
Now that I’m paid like a lawyer, I'm never running out of oil
One snap of my fingers, one word from my mouth
And rent for a year is made, wait, let me show you what

SESH
Even at my worst
Still kick it better than all the rest
Yes, you got it next
Well, go ahead
SESH is forever, never stress

SESH drip chains, glisten bad boy blunts like I'm a piston
Do you exist?
’Cause no one listen true to this shit
It's the point you missing
God mode, no clip, flying different
Lighter thumb is about to blister
Find me between dark and chipper
Call the dogs and I'mma sick 'em
Fly to shows, and come home richer
Life is funny when you live it
Death is lovely when you miss it
We all pass just like a mission
I accept it, I'm not dripping
I'm just eager to be out
Peel like the paint on the house

I hope you're all happy when I'm gone
Everybody I know, okay
Hate me to the core, okay
It's okay, I feel the same
One day I will go away
Permanently, permanently
I hope you're all happy when I'm gone

What?

They said shoot your shot and I shot it
If El say to go there's no stopping
Ask me to show you my balance
That's a whole lot of money allotted
Don't be all up in my pockets
And bitch do not question the process
I can show you how to do it
But promise you can't do it like us
H-E-double hockey sticks, my home I crawled up out of it
Fullmetal that weapon transmutates your bones like alchemist
Move to the breeze wherever it may flow
Move with the team wherever they may go
Put it down, stamp my name in this game
Since the day I turned to Bones, it ain't never been the same
Since we got it on our own, think I got the right to brag
But I'll leave that to these little rappers, small like they bags
Do not buy none of their lies, they just some tall tales
Little men with insecurities, too fucked to tell you
Got me sorry for you, I'll get therapy for you
Money make you what you always wanted, just a yuppie touring
I'm feeling sympathetic, you got me empathetic
The loudest ones have always been the worst and the most pathetic
But what do I know
I'm just a ghost
Hair hanging down my back, razor blade in my coat
#
I have never ever felt this way before
I have never ever felt this way
So I can't tell you how it goes

I have never done it so I wouldn’t know
I never tried this hard before
I'm on the ground but I knew it well
I've always tried to get out of hell
When my heart beats loud, do you hear me?
When my heart stops beating, will you feel me?
Or will you fear me?
Or will you fear me?
It’s time to show you just how it feels

Pull the sky down watch me pull it down
Pull the sky down watch me pull it down
Pull the sky down
Pull the sky down
Say goodbye to your life cause it's mine now

When the princess dies, is it game over?
If doors could talk, would they ever have closure?
Is a loving mother's son ever a soldier?
Is it ever too much weight I try to shoulder?
When I try my best, is it truly?
If I was a country, would you rule me?
Or would you fold me up like a map
When you find your path and you're back on track?
These are questions I feel never will be answered
Will we be this planet's helper or its cancer?

When my eyes open up, tell me, what do I see first?
If your dreams turned to female, would you seek her?
Can I still go on when I don't want to be here?
How long should I hold out 'til life seems fair?

Will my ears betray me if I finally start believing you?
Will I walk outside one day and see the sky not being blue?
Will we ever reach a time when humans aren't so see-through?
Would you be somebody else if you could not be you?
These are questions I feel never will be answered
Will we be this planet's helper or its cancer?
#
It is hard to go on
My days are spent hating myself
I wish I could feel happy

Catacomb creep, buried last week
But I came back just to witness your defeat
Worms in my teeth, mud on my body
Used to ride shawty with my hand on the shotty
Dial 5-1-7
Before the next 7 if you trying to get connected (what)
Don't look in the attic
I don't need an extra case while I'm running through the madness (SESH)
Too clean can't miss it, Clorox, boy, two blunts disinfected
Weeping willows steady hanging
Set the mood perfect, I just hope it start raining
You shot your shot and you missed (brick)
I step in quick and go swish (bitch)
I go so swish they don't tic-tic
Our shows be like Checking this shit off my wishlist
Tell me one person that's this-this
Deal with these kids like "tisk-tisk!"
They know my position is infinite
Never get low cause I always re-up
This is what dreams are made up of and I am Hillary Duff
Bum and a youngin, and I'm about to erupt
I suggest it's on eggshells around me you walk
Better be a sweetheart if you want to talk
If not, guess what, you get fucked
Painted on horns but a halo's what you got
Acting devilish get you burned on the spot

Spot, get you burned on the spot
Acting devilish get you burned on the spot
Yeah, get you burned on the spot
#
Bones casually increase the casualties
No, I never heard of your shit, don't bother asking me
I respawn back in my tomb, six feet of dirt on me
Drag myself out of where the worms and the vermin be
I thrive under odd circumstances
Used to pass out cashed, stomach singing like the Hansons
Dirt roads made me something you can't handle
The snow turn me cold, forever enchanting
Skeleton magic blade the attachment
You must be cracked if you think your shit smacking
We know the truth and you know the fable
I'm coming down hard no words no label
I just wake up, and it's over for your stable
Don't matter where you sit I turn the tables
Brain dead blunts got me feeling unable
Modern day pack got my lungs looking ancient
Eyelids shut, deep breath out in nature
Bet I break you bad news bet that you won't say shit
I know I'm the reason that you sweatin' trying to make shit
Can't nobody hear you if you never really saying shit (what)

Smokin' drugs with my heathens (heathens)

Bitch, it's DeadBoy season (season)
Welcome to the graveyard (graveyard)
Got a stone with your name on (with your name on)
Match woods we don't do those
Firearms you don't shoot those
Actin' like you do though (ay, ay)
Get you hurt it ain't new, no

Walkin' down the street and you know I'm stoned
Head in the sky and I'm all alone
Hell no, I don't need my phone
Try to hit my line, but I'm out the zone
Been off the charts, niggas know I'm gone
South side nigga long way from home
Got a bad foreign bitch she said she from Rome
I been heavy in the streets thuggin' all night long
So much on my mind, put it all in a song
Hard life take another hit of the strong
Know I'm not right out here living wrong
In the graveyard smokin' blunts, chillin' with Bones
Yeah

A split on you bitches, creepin' cat I hear 'em whisper (what?)
Ice on me, too much frostbitten, pendants make me shiver (uh)
Boy don't make me kill you, young gravedigger with that switcha (SESH)

It's like everybody done switched up (uh)
Whole damn game done flipped upside down lay down

It's time to get rid of (what, what)
These pussies that think they hot and winning (SESH, SESH, SESH, SESH, what)

(Ah)
Barely gone, barely here, uh
My team rarely ever fear none
Unless the woods start to get low
Then we-we pile up in the pick up to the store to get more
Slide under lavender skies
That blade is my disguise
I'm too ugly, please shield your eyes
That line might be reprised but It's a warning not a lie
See the shine on my side, now you got Stevie Wonders eyes
Sure ain't with the DeadBoys go pick another side
Shift back and forth until your morals have aligned
You never spent time on shit that really winds
Up and catapults you to a greater divine
"Stop, drop, and roll," I'm yelling it in the mirror
The human torch is here setting fire to my peers

Barely gone, barely here, uh
My team rarely ever fear none

Happiness, I ain't having it (having it)
I am not death, I am what's after it (after it)
Fucked up the plans on accident (accident)
Bones on top that's hazardous (hazardous)
We will teach you two to be back for me (back for me)
Rip it like a blunt on accident (accident)
So I have to dismantle you carefully (what)
Me I haven't even been there for me (what)
High 'fore you die, razor dipped in the ketamine
Spent my day smoking nights dreaming of a better me
Something you ain't ever seen, I ain't with the big of me
I just know it's funny cause I'm yet to be good to me
Seeing how far I can go on E
Without ever gassing up or trying to speed
The plot telling me this the season to bury 'em
Had the heart to go along, but no more time for sparing 'em
What

You fucked your life the day you ever thought to snake me (yeah)
Fuck a VHS, reframe your life in HD (it's you)
I'm in Saint P exchanging USD (see?)
You older than me? Then why you struggling like you sixteen (bitch)
Don't ever try the SESH (SESH)
You'll need more than your best (best)
Fast forwards and seen you next (next)
I'm taking more than flesh, yes

On the road I don't know what I'm chasing (chasing)
All I know is I'ma go 'till I'm ancient (ancient)

'Fore 19 minus 5 I'ma face it (face it)

You are a reflection of the trash that you stay with (stay with)
You can press me for my life I won't say shit (say shit)
Bitch, for my team, watch me die like life ain't shit (what)
There I go, there I go slamming caddie doors
You stay with hoes for you no sympathy inside these bones (ah)
Like dismissing drawing magic trying to evolve
You always move without your heart, you need money and fall

Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
Fall, fall, you gone fall off
What, yeah, SESH

Sad like a bad Goodbye
Deep down I know it was I that should have died
Regretting the missed calls, just thinking I'll call tomorrow
I was way too convinced
That you would see another day, and I would do this
Dial digits linked to you, and say I love and I miss you
Now I got issues, same place residential
Fuck everybody back home that knew what I did
Don't say you care about him, then assist his diminish
When I see you it's butcher knives, like I'm fresh out the kitchen
I promise I ain't leave the premises till I'm finished
Fuck shame, I'll spit on the corpses of you bitches
What

That's my life, what is here, so

I'm gifted with the mac
Swiftly I attack, burn me, I fire back
Flipping like acrobats, going agro
Defrost you like Spyro
Blunts got me tight-roped, the IRL psycho
Enter my domain, like URL's now I know
No backspace I make sure no typos
Shut your block down then lift you up like high notes
These can't buy those, sandals can't try those

No
Realistically I probably wouldn't even drop this
I don't know what to say
What?

SESH, what
SESH

Every day, every night
I don't know, what is right
I had to phase it in, you fell from grace
You'll never go, I'm falling off the deep again
The same as those few feel way too well
Never stop, swells just like a welt
Never stop, swells just like a welt
Never stop, swells just like a welt

Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS

Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Weapon on my side
Fuck 'em I eject 'em like a VHS
Weapon on my side
I don't need no help
Better than me? Oh, well
Look down at my feet like "Oh well"
I'ma take my ball and go home
Reflect on my thoughts alone
Regret all the above
I'm trying to get out this rut
It's hard to walk through the mud
I know deep down you don't see nothin' in me
My respiratory system stops whenever you leave
I wish I could turn into a harder me
Cause I know deep down you don't see nothin' in me
What
#
I bet my whole check, might rip that
SESH put it to ten, quit, dismiss that
Whatever dreams may bring yeah, we get that
Whatever it take to be great, we did that
Check-mate, it's your turn
Think twice, smoke three 'fore I help you to learn
Fee-fi-fo-fum, who dare to disturb
The giant lurking in the dark, long hair like I was stunned
Back in the days
Rag to the face
Back to the wall
The trash was my fate
Escaped somehow by the skin of my teeth
Even though I was froze like the rims on the jeep
E-Break through the snow, pull up we be
Seven days just passed, I think we need we sleep ('eep-'eep)
I think we need a sleep, seven days past, I think we need a sleep

Pull the trigger Budd Dwyer

To the kids at home, watch it, no, don't try it (don't try-try it)
Try to stop me, you get dropped just like my eyelids (uh-uh)
Where you at, where you at, wait I found ya (yikes!)
No point in runnin' for cover, no way around it (what)
Wait a second, let me smoke, go ahead count it (count it all)
Hundred minutes, hundred blunts you know my body (know my body)
Want you bad almost got me writing bounties (writing bounties)
There ain't nobody but Bones, baby I got you (what)
Every blaze hurt my back and fuck my posture (fuck it)
Flood your bezzle, reflect everything like water (water)
Step on the SESH lands you bound to get slaughtered (phew-phew)
Go ahead and knock them back and do just what I taught ya
Ya girl she lied to you when she say that she wants ya
I know you hurting bending pockets just like corners

My insecurities swiftly cover me like armor
Head to toe, I'm untarnished
The best on the market stand forever unpunctured
The prime example left the scene now it don't function
I can handle resentment in abundance
My DNA is made of regrets and sunsets
Reset on my back, I can't touch it
Won't go back to the beginning if I had the option

Wait
Too much focused on dying I forgot to think about living
Just wanted an introspective minute
What
Got to think about living, just wanted an introspective minute

Titanium pressed against your cranium
Deadboys decaying just to end up slaying 'em
Bitch no we do not know your songs, we never playing 'em
Boy your chain is not what you think, that shit uranium
Chain in the grave and I'm switchblade glazing
I'm undertow to them, aggressive there's no saving them
I went on vacation and I came back with more than
I have ever seen in my life, that's one tour shit
Whole game flawed, but SESH flawless
So let the whole game lie, while SESH honest
Tell me why everyone long to be the same
Look, sound, act, everyday every way
I cannot relate to the shit that's popping
The words that they speak says nothing about me
Playing with the nines, lose you eye like Ralphie
You and yours will starve running round for that clout shit
I don't go out bitch Bones, stay in (in)
Dwelling in the dark till the new moon begin (begin)
Razor on my palm, let me show you the precision (phew)
Since the beginning been kicking it, now my neck is a river

Every single day gotta make that pay
Lying when you tell 'em that you spray that 'K
You don't want violence you don't want no pain
Actin' permanent never especially in this game
Bitch, no way, I'ma give it like a day
Matter of fact not even that, one more second until you fade
Just like that, gone in broad day
Workin' and lookin' like all you do is play
Speakin' different lingo I don't know what y'all say
Like the name of Me and Xay first tape, y'all Lame
Got somethin' in the safe for how you say rainy day
No need to say a thing if you ain't bout to say names

Hol' up wait a second I been feelin' all my senses frying
Twistin' till my fingers bleed and SESHin' till I'm fucking dying
Hol' up wait a second I been feelin' all my senses frying

We're here 24 hours a day! This is just what you're looking for!

And they're gonna fake it, Ryan... gonna float it... for, THE TOUCHDOWN!-
"Aww!"
"Guys, we gotta go, I'm done being stuck in this den with you guys every single week, watching football!"
"Man, where would we even go?"
"Jamaica?"
"Jamaica?!"
"Yeah, let's go! Just, dudes, let's go"
*Plane flying sound*
Three friends take a trip of a lifetime in search for something different

"Welp, guys, we made it. It's beautiful out here. Look at the water, it's so clear, so-"
Take a chance
"How the fuck did we even come here?"
"Man, even in Jamaica we can't get in here."
"What do you mean? Let's just keep WALKING, we're here for a couple more days, have fun-"
But little did they know
"Wassup boys? Looking for the girl?"
"...Who're you?"
"Don't worry about it, man, just follow me, one time"
"Come on guys, let's go."
"Sinkar, who is your friend, man?"
"Oh, don't worry man, they with me."
"No. They need the tattoo."
*The sound of a tattoo machine*
"Aaaahhhh!"
"Man, what's this song? We've been hearing it ever since we've been here."
"What song is this?"
"Heh, what song is this? Look at the tattoo you're getting. I take it you boys have been to Phlapepatown"
"Ho-how did you know?"
"Heh... Look at my arm. Yep. I've been down with Phlape for about a... say 12 years. Aaand I'm finished. There, you boys, go, I hope you guys have a good time. You like this?"
"It's great"
"Yeah, sick"
"Thanks, man"
"Of course, man"
"Let's go!"
*Door creek*
"Welcome."

So what are you waiting for? Come on and visit us, we're located in the [?] Gomez strip mall. Right next to... Dublins
And now, please... We're located right next to Dublins

SESH
Graveyard walk to the rhythm
Yelling fuck whoever with 'em
If I walk in there's an issue (what)
Reversing how you feeling
One verse and I turn to villain
You're cursing me with the minutes (wait)
My work will never be finished
Sesh always on extra innings
The second I want to leave, then I go
You're caught in the fold
You thought it was gold
Now you sippin' on fours
Just to numb your soul
Signed off on something you could've done on your own
Contracts italicize your life in bold
Every time we do a show, now they catching a cold
But we know how it roll, that's a victory goal
No mercy for those who can get it, but don't
Sympathize with those, who need help but won't
Alone in the ocean, drilling holes in the boat
I'm the ghost in the attic, I'm the noise in your room
Breaking down is a habit, coming back is a curse
Keep me out of my own head and spare me the truth

[?] get out of my head and spare me the truth
What, wh-

"Hey, man, it's pretty cool, you shoulda seen it"
"You did what?!"
*A lot of people talking simultaneously*
"Oh, no, no, no, no, guys. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute guys
WAIT A MINUTE! WHERE IS LERON"
*Music starts playing*
"Come in. Gomer, have a seat."
"Sir, you wanted to talk to me?"
"Gomez, it's about your performance. You got toxic waste all over the food department."
"If you're talking about the fork lift on Thursday, that was Rodriguez."
"Rodriguez came in here talking about you. And I have footage."
"Boss! Rodriguez is all bullshit! No brass!"
"Then explain this, Gomez. Rodriguez is in a hospital. His radiation levels are off the charts."
"That's very unfortunate."
"Gomer. Are your eyes even opened?"
Chill, brother
"Just a little swelling, sir. I was swimming in a pool. Lots of chlorine."
"Gimble, this is on behalf of me and the lives that were lost because of your negligence. Get out of my office and never come back."
You're FIRED

"I just needed to see ya
I'd like to a... take you out"

Look, now my brain is buffering
I'm stompin' through cathedrals from the sixteen hundreds
Hope you don't praise the stuntin'
Out your play book look, you ain't impressing nothin'
And we get it you on a whole 'nother grind
Now let us be we risin' paintings from a whole 'nother time
Oils on the canvas, you up on my mind
I wish we could hop in these pictures and hit rewind
Slow dying, woods keep me grounded
El keep the strangers from around me
In the stream they drown and that's how they gon' find 'em
If they ever harm anybody that surround me
TeamSESH too astoundin', BONES won't allow this game not to be ours
Cut some cards and flowers, send 'em to your door over night for you cowards
There's no fights in [?] a couple years ago 'fore I made a couple dollars
Now let's put 'em on the market
End this shit quick, should have never ever started, what

TEVAL (SESH)

Fuck all your vanity, shame on your family
Death to your friends and the ones that you love
No one containing me, utter calamity
See what you made me do? Look what you done
TeamSESH, DeadBoy, drop it on your head boy
Never not cashed, make a mountain of ash
Every day of the past I dread boy
I stumble over my own feet, too high to function
I'm coming, open up my catalog, I've done it
To be humble, you say you underground, but you just under
Honest, every time we drop we got them running
What

"Warning, warning, warning, warning
Warning, warning, warning, warning"
"This is a message from General Mark Meeks
If you're receiving this message, you're in the blast zone
Cities within forty miles are infected
You must seek shelter immediately"

Yeah, you can talk, but, no, you can't hide
Engine that couldn't bitch you cannot ride
The track that I'm on is for the divine
DeadBoys multiply then divide
WhiteNoise on the screen, make me blind
SESH is the one that I trust now
I got no need for a bust down
Used to be down, but I'm up now

You ain't really out here sellin' zips, zips (boy)
You could do a tour and make Zip, Zip (nada)
Zero competition so they pissed, pissed (ah)
I get on a stage and just rip, rip

They say I wanna do it like you do, Bones
You radiating something like your Bluetooth on
The glimmer in the night, you the hope that we owe
I ain't shit but a corpse, it's the flow that put me on
Early in the morning (what)
Cutting up roaches
Stretching and yawning (fuck)
SESH been up on it (what)
What's an opponent?
It's been so long since I've known one

Always tell your bitch, you ain't fucking with the clique
Acting like this, get you gone in a pinch
Only face to face when I talk, fuck a diss
Waiting, waiting, waiting

Where were you when me and Xay made Lame
Where were you when me and Chris made that SeaBeds
Eddy get ready, I told you we'd see this
El let it drop, I get it done
Fuck all them stories, you ain't from the block
Dodging them shots, you were folding your sock
Act like you out here, but no, you is not

Blunt wrap, rip like tissue (tissue)

Bad thoughts drop like missiles
Geronimo, you know Bones gonna miss you (bye)
Sunny came home with a mission (mission)
I done tried to put 'em on nutrition (nutrition)
But the point was something that they was missing
I can scream it, but I promise these bitches they wouldn't listen
In the dark but somehow the grave still shining
Off in the cave with the bats reclining
Feet up on the rocks, ring flash like lighting
We the weathermen, change the weather, no lying
Shit don't ever get hard, it just get better
High before I get up, remember when I was fed up
Shit don't ever get hard, it just get better
High before I get up, remember when I was fed up with life
Like I was begging to die
Had synthetic in my lungs when we broke in the ride
Had money on my mind when the snow was on the ground
Silent night, no sound, back roads breakin' down

Packin' the blade, running away, every night the same
We got away, I was in pain, had to get away
Packin' the blade, running away, every night the same
We got away, I was in pain, had to get away

More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the (fuck it)
More bang for your buck, had that thing up in the (bust it)

Droppin out the town that most ain't ever heard about
Poppin out, they turning heads, I guess they hear me now
I'm a legend, underground treasure, someone to learn about
Kill at my leisure, pick up and dead 'em
I almost concern myself (what)
Never was one for the wealth (wealth)
Give me some blunts and my health (health)
If I can't have both, I'm choosing death
Tell me, what the fuck's a law
When you within castle walls
I get fruit, water, dope, woods to wrap 'em with one call

Lay me down, come and make my day
I've been waiting since yesterday
Patiently, I have suppressed the rage
Spend my whole life going down the drain
Lay me down, come and make my day
I've been waiting since yesterday
Patiently, I have suppressed the rage
Spend my whole life going down the drain

What?
Big Ern McCracken, lose your hand if you reachin' (reachin')
Get you Munson'd on sight, I don't need a reason (reason)
Think you had a hard night, wait until I see you (wait)

If you ain't from the woods, you don't know about this (no)
Fam lay rock 'n roll, no car walk to store (store)
No money in my Levis unless we pulled a move (ah)
Always in a drought still we high off something I don't wish on you
Heart stopping like red lights, I'm shaking, I can't fight it
We strung out like Christmas lighting, hanging over the fire
Would push my blade in your tires
Would flip and switch up the climate
If life was fucked for me, it's fucked for you
There's no getting by it
Bitch I was petty and slimey
Like a slug, a trail was behind me
Wishing I could stop and rewind me
Hit play before I was like me
Before I turned to the worst
'Fore I gave in to the curse
My DNA is screaming at me
Every night I am hurt
Do not ask me what the time is
Bitch it's always too late
Dug myself too deep, my nails will break if I escape
Now how the fuck I'm supposed to roll a wood straight?
Outta luck, got me like a vase
Drop me, watch me break

SESH 'till I rest ('till I rest)
'Till I put both hands across my chest, goodnight
SESH (SESH) 'till I rest ('till I rest)
'Till I put both hands on my chest, goodnight
"Lemme take this piss... alright, peace out"

Virus

Your mixtape need a laugh track, I'm past that
Tell your manager, take his check and go cash that
He gonna need it, hope that he just save it
Rainy days are coming, 'cause your gimmick is fading
I picture Eden in my head and hope one day I get to visit
A place with no stealing, killing, no diamonds or digits
No barely swimming fishes in the creek, they don't fit in
Drain the water, have a feast to me, you really just dinner
All y'all pitiful, look at all y'all benefit off
Of taking another style to pass as original
I'm a whole different animal, I am me to a fault
Showed the world my worst traits and kept the best in a vault
It's like a dark obsession, with never showing my all
I am the man behind the curtain making shapes on the wall
What?

I am the man behind the curtain making shapes on the wall
SESH
What?

Yeah
I pulled the sword from the stone
I saved the village in Rome
I traveled back to 30 BB, that's way before Bones
I fought off hordes of orcs, swingin', slingin' swords of force
Lighting up my copper torch, it's easy like the Commodores
The missing gear is I, shinin' while I wait to die
They talk shit until they see me, then they can't decide
They look into my eyes and see a rather awful shine
They cannot quite put their finger on why I am not alright
Well join the club, answer's something I would love
But I don't think I'll ever get a reply like I'm signing off
I'm sliding off with something fucked inside the blunt that got me
Cashed every day, do not depend on me for nothing (what)
(-depend on me for nothing, what)

When we out, riding round, we don't skrrt, skrrt
Bending corners very slowly, like the speed hurt, hurt (like it hurt)
Say you got that work, but bitch, you unemployed
Yes, I surely get annoyed
With all of that "I'm the man" from little boys

I get shit bumping, like I got no choice
Jump in the hearse before I hop in a Royce
Before you left Earth, all you heard was a voice
Bones is the reason you now are destroyed
Fuck with the boy, fuck with the king
Brain on my chain, got your eye in my ring
Sit on my throne fashioned out of your skin
If you hear a scream, SESH at it again
Foam at the mouth, I'm rabid again
Christ has risen, the passion is here
Alive and well, and kicking the cure
The remedy say my name twice, and I'm there
All you need's ash, no need for a mirror
Draw out a square, step inside there
Follow directions so close, you can feel it
If you did it right, now I am here (what)

Creek on the creep, B on the lurk
You can sip mud, I'll stay feeling like dirt
Bitch

Nightmare please come my way
I don’t wanna sleep tonight
Nightmares keep me awake
I don’t need good dreams tonight

Boo
SHWB dipped in diamonds, watch it boom
Smoke too fading just like Boosie Boo, do watch me Zoom
Wipe me down, hop in the crowd, comin' back with all my jewels
My deadboys know the rules, mud up on my shoes

Bad news in my brain cells
I think I’m okay but I can’t tell
Bad news in my brain cells
I think I’m okay but I can’t tell

What?
Fine China blunts with the porcelain smoke
Nowadays there's no shortage on the poor man's Bones
Look around, see the game, take it in, what you say?
Too much death in my veins, I can't live off what you think
(SESH)

Nightmare please come my way
I don’t wanna sleep tonight
Nightmares keep me awake
I don’t need good dreams tonight

Flatline, Flatline, someone call the hotline

Bow your head to SESH, give thanks like November

When it's cold, baby, I'll keep you warm
The temperature low, well let me turn the heat on
Rain with the snow, wood for the smoke
Wind let it blow just like we in our own world
I gotta know I said "I'd like to know, are you okay?"
And I lie awake 'till I find a way to make it all alright
When it's cold, baby, I'll keep you warm
The temperature low, well let me turn the heat on
Rain with the snow, wood for the smoke
Wind let it blow just like we in our own world
I gotta know I said "I'd like to know, are you okay?"

Dead of the night, wake up and I'm so concerned
I dont know why I just lie right back down and go to sleep
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep

It woke me up on a Sunday, an hour before the sun

Act like you runnin' the game (game)
Bitch you ain't runnin' a thing (thing)
The day that we face to face (face)
You'll end up running away (-way)
You ain't got nothin' to say (say)
Yellin' but I don't hear rage
Bones come down like the rain
Flood your whole section, SESH wash 'em away
Say your last words quick
Hit the fast forward bitch
Show you what this earth is like without you in it (what)
Salute or get booted, bitch I'm the Lieutenant (ah-ah)
You gettin' breakfast, I'm finishing dinner (what)
We on two whole different schedules
Kickin' back while you stressin' 'bout a contract (contract)
Erase your memory after first contact (contact)
From a place, you wouldn't fathom harbors life (harbors life)
Where all is dead and everyday look just like night (just like night)

You done fucked up
Thinking that you can fuck around with the team
You done fucked up
Thinking that you can get away from me
You done fucked up
Thinking that you can fuck around with the team
You done fucked up
Thinking that you can get away from me
You done fucked up

Motherfuck today, bitch I'm waiting on tomorrow
D-19 reppin' where you die or get offed
Lost in the woods, keep a weapon in the car
Or get left near the railroad, the forest is your morgue
Addiction off the Richter, feeling like I'm Dave Navarro
Motherfuck today, bitch I'm waiting on tomorrow
Settin' off alarms, fire storm without warnin'
Tell me tone it down, don't ever hear it, bitch I'm in the moment
Reaper forever sittin' right by me
Waitin' until it's perfect timing
I'm in full 360 surveillance, that bitch will never get to me
He know what the consequence is when you steppin' to me

What's the deal, how you feel?
What's the deal, how you feel?

God damn, hot damn, hotter than a frying pan
Put me on the stove, don't touch me
I'm 'bout to fly and go to Russia
Privet to the rubles I'm touchin'
Bust it forever used to nothin', gunnin' till the day we ain't hungry
Fuck it, can't recite a verse of Marvin Gaye, then I don't trust you
Buggin' used to white truck it, rust in my cuts can't stomach
Someone cue the violence bleeding from my eyelids
Nosferatu in the dungeon
Super 8 film burn dissipate my features
Can't make out who is it that that's creepin'
Fall with the night, turn you to ash without a light
Show you the past, I project out my hands at your eyes
Feel it in your spine, these memories are alive
As for you, I am pleased to say it's your time

What's the deal, how you feel?
What's the deal, how you feel? (bitch)
What's the deal, how you feel?
What's the deal, how you feel? (bitch)

Used to really want it 'til I got it, now I don't want it no more
Feel like I'm frozen, glitchin' and smokin', now I live in slow-mo
I'm the one hurting me
I am not worth a thing, to me at least, or so it seems
I don't deserve a me

Shut my eyes and see a perfect world
I don't belong, -long, -long
Try my best sometimes but still
Forever wrong, wrong, wrong
Shut my eyes and see a perfect world
I don't belong, -long, -long
Try my best sometimes but still
Forever wrong, wrong, wrong

Blunt to my lips, all my people pistol grippin'
Put you on the list only if your ass trippin'
Bitch, you ain't livin', you barely getting by
Hopin' every night like "I hope life goes alright"
You a fuckin' clone, a carbon copy
Around here you get no play, no other option
I'ma put a bomb on you and whoever you ride with
You always said you wanted to blow up, well, perfect timing

I don't know, dope got me off
I don't really feel myself, -self, -self
No hope dying but I won't
Still holdin' on for whatever reason I don't, don't
Give it up, no I can't let it go
Been a victim too many times, I can't cope
Conversate with too many walls, too many ghosts
Don't know how to speak to a human in the world
Breathin' and leavin' these blunts I have rolled
Cashed in the tray, got that smoke in my throat
Chokin', still rolling, that buck knife I'm holdin'
It's 4 in the morning, no Bones is not snoring
I'm blending in with the shadows
I'm moving swiftly down your alley
My mind I can't control sadly
So be careful when you walkin' past me
White noise, echo in my head 24/7
Static brain, pixelated chain reach and you finished
In your face like the dentist, if bitches wanna come near me
I got that equalizer reach, you deceased if you hear me
SESH
There is no stoppin' Deadboy when he droppin'
Since Rotten been cursed with a virus unknown
I glow in the dark, end you before you start
Open your chest, put a SESH on your heart
Bitch
What, what
Stop, bitch
SESH

What? Ooh-ooh-ooh
Still in the dark where the light don't go
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Don't ask me how I'm doing, promise you don't wanna know
You've changed, you are not the same as before
I can see it in your eyes right when you walk through the door
Wind is pickin' up, I see the clouds starting to form
When I'm sitting with you, I am in the eye of the storm

I can feel it, anyone could feel it
No, it doesn't take a genius
I can feel it, anyone could feel it
No, it doesn't take a genius
To know that something's wrong
I just wanna talk
To know that something's wrong
I just wanna talk
SESH, what?

Woods low, now we need some more
Got some dope but we got nothin' to roll
Hit the door like let's go hit the store
Hit the store, let's go hit the store
And get a light, need to smoke before the flight
Road life, different region every night
Cities change quicker, this weathers got me shiverin'
Got on the flight with a jacket
Hop off, gotta take it off cuz this heat is sweltering
SESH on my chest 'till I turn into dust
100 blunts in my lungs before the moon replace the sun

Night time rolling with the windows down
Night time rolling with the windows down
What?

I wish I could breathe
I wish I could watch the sunset and rise
I wish I could be just like you
I wish I was not a failure

I slide by coming at ya in Hi-Fi (WHAT UP)
Tryna see if you pussies got nine lives (PULL UP)
Everytime I don't feast, I fine dine turn ya
Corpse to bread, turn ya blood into wine
Mr. Disinfected heart pumping garbage, still clogging my veins
I remember nights of loneliness and day full of pain
With the shadows, I would battle till I hemorrhage my brain
Synthetic blunts had me daze for days
I would succumb to my weakness, crazed from the drinking
Locked in a mode, no control overthinking
Weight up on my shoulder, cannot carry it no more
Ears on mute and my eyes on slow-mo

You wouldn't fuck with the one they call
You wouldn't fuck with the one they call
Bones, the god of the microphone
Straight out the 517 zone
You wouldn't fuck with the one they call
You wouldn't fuck with the one they call
Bones, the god of the microphone
Straight out the 517 zone

You want me to keep going?
Alright

So I was chilling on the corner, and what else?
I was rolling up a blunt, and what else?
Said I was chilling on the corner, and what else?
Said I was rolling up a blunt, and what else?
Bones, the god of the microphone

Breeze, flow through the trees
I was with the team, rolling Cutlass Supreme
The light turned red and I noticed in the rear-view
An El Camino with a windshield so dark I couldn't see through
I quickly reach for my strap
I never hesitated to lay a punk on his back
Drew got the gauge and Soup got the mac
We'll have a blast for days and you know that's a fact
The light turned green, now we taking a left
They take a left too, I ain't convinced yet
Without taking a breath I said, "Now B take a right"
As they followed our lead I said, "It's on alright"
It was a...

A night like none other
A night like none other

Now everybody in the whip getting ready for shit
Jesus slapping on a vest, Creek stacking the clips
All doors open up, boots touch the ground
As we walk towards the El Camino they get out
Hooded up, masked up, they walk towards us
One steps before the rest and spins the barrel of his gun
Before it got to stop, all you heard was POP POP
Young Bones had to turn them motherfuckers to rot
It was a...

A night like none other
A night like none other
A night like none other

You know who it is
Back from the mothafucking dead

Ryze

Fuck where you’re at, fuck where you been
Fuck what you’re bumping if it ain’t the team
Fuck do you mean you’re the king of the ring?
You must’ve been popping too much of them beans
Living a dream but I’ll be your night
Terror wake you and take you on a flight
Off of the grid, into the mist
Missing forever, you will not be missed
Boy, get a grip, from the abyss
Came out of mist with conditions for grim
Wake up and piss, sleeping and shit
Life of a rat back in Michigan
If I go back, I will flip again
Blow up the block with the house that they in
Creeping, I dip to the Holiday Inn
Now Bones just got away with it again

Tick, tock, tick, tock
Tick, tock, time’s running out for ya
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Tick, tock, time’s running out for ya

Hit 'em with a one tap headshot dirt nap
Ridin' in a hearse with five percent
Tint on the front of the windshield
I can see you but you cannot see in
Rain, rain, come again
Drop top, feel the summer wind
Every year we do it again
We get it, we got it, you follow the trends
Go with the wind, whatever they do
You command+V every flow you got through
You look at me and you seeing right through
Got no reflection, no, that’s nothing new
That’s nothing new
That’s nothing new, yeah
That’s nothing new, yeah

Hey guys, I'm here to talk to you about the new upcoming Doonkie Deluxe. It slices, it dices, and leaves everything smooth as butter, it's the doonger. We all remember those dinosaur chicken nuggets. Look at the end of the Doongie piece, it's a dinosaur stamp. You can literally stamp anything into a dinosaur. And if you call in the next 15 minutes, you will not only get one, but two mini Dongers (oh my god, it's not Dongers, it's Dingles!) and if you call in the next 15 minutes, you will also get a free mini thing. Call 1-800-366-4355. That's 1-800-DOONGLE, with two O's

There's just not enough time in the day
Not enough for me to say what I wanna say
There's just not enough time in the day
24 hours never been enough for me anyway

There's not enough hours from the AM to PM
Gotta get what I need quick and dip bam
It's like this and like that and like this
I'm cruisin' down the strip with a razor in my fist
I'm crawlin' up on 5th, sittin' on chrome rims
Spokes is pokin', pimp is focused
Money ain't foldin', on silent, don't call me
Get the dial tone in real life when you approach me
The flow is just a habit, I'm spazzin' until I wrap it up
Pack it in a bag, reverse back it up to the lab and I'm ghost
I'm the storm on the coast, I'm the sun when it's close
Touch Bones and you toast
I'm the thorn in the rose
(Watch your finger)

Back at it, I jackhammer the competition
I lack manners, don't pack glamour, forgot to mention
I keep a weapon in my coat
And on the days it ain't cold I throw it in my sock
Bump it in the trunk, motherfuck trust
All I need is blunts, put the dope in my lungs
Bump it in the trunk, motherfuck trust
All I need is blunts, put the dope in my lungs

There's just not enough time in the day

Drop bombs on wack MC's that's actin' new (yeah)

Sesh Compound, blunts lit, bumpin' motown (Mm-hmm)
Hit 'em with the pro sound, then I go ghost (Yeah)
Forever in the attic, hittin' all the wrong notes (Ah)

Where do I begin? (Yeah)
I began in the land that was frozen
Spent my time huddled around the fire just hopin' (Oh yeah)
Till I turned 14, thawed out and noticed
That they don't lock the doors on the cars around the corner
If you wanna detect me you need sophisticated sonar
Ash drop slow, but the snow fall slower
Never had the funds till I struck with the scrap
Yard full of metal, crowbar in my bag

(Well, alright)

Hey Bones man, hey Bones, what's up my nigga, how you doin' mate?

Check it
In my room feeling ruined like Pompeii
Just trying to get my head on straight, through all the way
Thinking about the day, the last time I saw your face
I only wish I could've told you come with me on the plane
Makes me wanna murder, cry, and love all in one
Emotion, promise I will always be there for your son
Sometimes I just wanna switch roles and change gears
Like I wish that I was gone and you were right here
Emotion, mind overflowin'
I wish that I could turn it off but it keep going
I wish that I could hit the brake, but I keep rolling
And if they talking down, prepare for the chosen one
You've just begun, I been
Doing this shit since Nick had the blimp
You too new to shit to be a threat
BONES sneeze on the track and knock you off the map
Like that

(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breathe
(You know I don't sleep much)
Can't remember the last time I dreamed
(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breathe
(You know I don't sleep much)

You wanna step? Better learn how to battle
Sucka MC's get slammed like gavels
When words do travel and cases unravel
Now you caught up with Five years in Federal
Security expose your insecurities
If I show you the realest me you will faint up on the scene, capisce
Off the leash I'm a freak, put on a beat and I eat
I throw me a new rapper that think he fucking with me
I destroy, here come the noise
Came to get down, bad boy like Detroit
Tell them I breathe the same since I been in it
Hit the ribbon before they even start
Bitch I'm finished
Check it

(You know I don't sleep much)
Midnight and it's hard to breath

Can't remember the last time I dreamed

Earth so fucked up, got me so fucked up, so I stay fucked up too
Gotta be on level playin' field when you takin' on the elephant in the room
The food is poison, don't drink the water
We are all pigs in a massive slaughter
Soon we will see what it means to tarnish
Winters gettin' colder, every summer gettin' hotter
Sweatin' underneath the rays, rollin' up watchin' the world end
Best seat in the house reserved for SESH, now start the whirlwind
Debris fallin', sirens callin' out to the world, no signs of stoppin'
Baller blockin', you get locked in a box to keep inside my pocket
Tell me please what's the word now
Everyone hopin' I slow it down
Fuck is up, you know it's goin' down
Feel like Yung Joc when I'm up in your town
Saw what you built and I burnt it down
Funny how smoke is a calming sound
The sizzle of nothing that once was a something
The transfer of matter turn you to a cloud

Smoked
Rob your dreams and kill your hope, now you smoked
On the curb, like a joke, bitches know
What it do and what it don't, yeah it's Bones

Blind from the sunshine, wrist (Wrist)
Tired from the moonlight, diamonds shinin' off my chest
I hide it, no, never, it's out in the Winter
Catching the snow, smokin', watchin' it glimmer in slow-mo (-mo)
If we close to low, I get up and hit the store
We pullin' out for the cause, we slidin' back up with dope

What?

Bones to the front, hair to the back (Back)
SESH forever last like nobody in the past (Past)
Did before, they crawlin' when we flow (Flow)
Reachin' for the team, got em drowning in a moat (Moat)
Lower the draw bridge, whoever's in arm's length
Is getting napalm sprayed for like infinite days
Got infinite rage, turn to Jin on a stage
Tekken live when we show up in your city and state
Coat rippin' from the wings growing outta my back
Head down in a stance like I'm about to attack
They lookin' winded, Bones fine, I'm just doin' some laps
I was workin' on my craft when my friends all left
I was 15 then, now just look how time passin'
Turned a moldy mattress to a scumbag castle
How he do that? I call it deadboy magic
How he do that? I call it deadboy magic

It's always funny when life is going well
All I can do is fall under the spell
Some days in my head is where I dwell
And sometimes I can't save myself from hell
I'm forever in the middle, I could snap or I could giggle
I have yet to find the thing that determines which way I'm leanin'
I'm rarely up on the scene and whenever I do get seen
Just know I wanted to do a show, give a fuck about an appearance
You talk, I never hear it, you dropped, I never seen it
Whether it's platinum or it sold five, still wouldn't wanna be ya
You pop, then end up freezin', locked in the box they see you
Stuck in the mud with creatures who never had your best interests
You thought shit could be different, now you just appeasing
People that don't really need you, you need them so bad you fiending

This life has got you
This life has got you
This life has got you
This life has got you

Just another victim and you can't come back
Just another doll with a string in his back
Same old lines on the same old tracks
What
Just another victim and you can't come back
Just another doll with a string in his back
Same old lines on the same old tracks

Wait
SESH
Bones
What

Same old number, brand new home
Just wish that I could call my little brother on the phone
Everything we done, I just wish that I could show 'em, I owe 'em
Forever better I gotta chance to know 'em
I dream about him every night, so every day I'm waking up
Picturing his face smiling, eyes lit up
Never have I seen such a beautiful picture
The sky don't get blue no more, it only get darker

This life has got me
This life has got me
This life has got me
This life has got me
#
When all is said and done
We will all be dust soon, so who cares anyway
Lower me in the ground
Holdin' on to memories will lead you to one place
Nightmares, nightmares
If you wake up, I'll be right here
#
Delete the memories, reap the benefits
Dope forever lit, sleep I never get
Dreams irrelevant when you start livin' 'em
Fuck the dividends, do it for different shit
Team on the scene, chemicals on my coat
Professor Bones show 'em who is the bomb
Construct a building just to watch it fall
If you hear a kek from the shadows, be gone
Warning, warning, SESH don't give those
Every time I creep, it's out the blue through the window
To the wall, to the blood, drip down and fall
All my deadboys crawl, oh, I'll be there by tomorrow
You can bet on that I come out the black, I'm the great white bat
Take you home back to my cave, they haven't seen you in days
A bad addiction for shade, always away from the rays
You got no real shit to say, cut it out, give it a break
Lay it down deep in a grave to never be heard from again
#
Hold up, don't get me started
I cannot beg your pardon
I'm not too keen on talking
But I can't hold my tongue
No more, I'm a failure at home
And on road
It never matters where I'm at, I'm gonna fold
No hope, no goals
I'm fading slow
I gotta get back to my zone
Back in my mode
Where I was born, made gold
And made more
Molds for these rappers
Then I thought, like "Oh no"
Don't move, razor in your face 'til your body grow cold
Hold up, don't get me started
I cannot beg your pardon
I'm not too keen on talking
But I can't hold my tongue
No more, I'm a failure at home
And on road
It never matters where I'm at, I'm gonna fold
No hope, no goals
I'm fading slow
I gotta get back to my zone
Back in my mode
Where I was born, made gold
And made more
Molds for these rappers
Then I thought, like "Oh no"
Don't move, razor in your face 'til your body grow cold

Droppin' down hoppin' out straight out the casket
Pop lock and drop ya like Huey done asked me
Mud on my corpse, if you crazy I'm batshit
Bones is the one the game hate with a passion
When did it start, I think I know
The second I chose to come out of my tomb
Everyone gather and hold hands
And let out a big "Fuck you Bones" on two
One two, coming through
Your crew look like too wong foo
Give a fuck about your loot
Motherfucker gimme truth
And if you all out of the latter I'mma have to take the first
Try to bop me for my spot
Hold up, someone get this boy a hearse

I'm taking the long way home tonight
I just need some space, I don't wanna live today
Ran into the crow of the afterlife
He opened up his beak whispered, "Bones, please come with me"
Deadboy, what big eyes you have
The better to see you with
Hands of the witch cursed with one grip
I will rise from the fire
Finna blow away with the breeze
Reporting live from the core
Making it hard to breathe

I could breathe wrong and trigger them all
You don't gotta say shit when you on
Walking proof that a human can do wrong
Make you an example, send you home, like tell them all
Thought that you could play me for a bitch I make a call
No, it's not for backup, it's for you to break it down
Give me what you got cause I bet I ain't have that
Ducking me like AFLAC, I'll drop you like the NASDAQ
Digital dash pad flash when we pass that
House where you at location we done cached that
All I've ever wanted was some face to face contact
Hold up, what you say, bitch, Bones didn't catch that
Straight facts, quickly react bitch, I push your brain back
Hate that we came up ourselves no one can say that
Straight facts, quickly react bitch, I push your brain back
Hate that we came up ourselves no one can say that
I am the reason you buzzing I think that you that puzzled, my boy, you have got me confused
Thinking I'll pull out this hate for no reason to aim it at random and let off a few
I got a trunk with a lock and key that I stash in the woods for one day to be used
I truly hope that somebody will stray far enough from path and be ready to view

Secrets unleashed with one twist of the key
Studied to the n-th degree, die and report back to me

Fuck what you think, bitch
Fuck what you thought
'Til my corpse rot, DeadBoy to the top
Try to give it what you got but what you got ain't enough
Time to hang it up, take a walk, get lunch
Everything untouchable will always get touched
Skeleton hands remain through the flood
Floating down the street, up to no good
I done see ya hood now let me take you to the woods

Decomposing, decomposing (Yeah)
Every second decomposing (Yeah)
Decomposing, decomposing
Every second decomposing (Wait)

Throw some silica gel packs inside my casket
Don't need to mold, already live through that shit
Hold up the store if they keep on asking
"Bones, who did you sign to?", — yes, I'd imagine
That it would seem that way, now tell me is it good or bad?
The hundred dollar bill pass just for the wood packs
No, not at all, it was El that booked that
If you want a show, it depends how I feel, bitch

I won't flip for some bills, bitch
Do a frickin' cartwheel for 8 dollars
I won't do a cartwheel for 8 dollars, I won't

Still doped up
Don't approach me when I'm rolling up
Gold blunt guts in the platinum cup
I kill my lungs and left my body numb
Can't feel a thing you could put me in the rain
Droplets running down my face
But my skin cannot sense a thing

Hold up, hold up
Every day I'm getting
Older, older
Every night I'm tryna
Focus, focus
But I can't get it
There's something wrong with my head
And I can't explain it
I'm running out of options if I ever had any, try not to panic
Body itching I'm trying to kick it, life's my bad habit
I cause a scene then I'm napping, goodnight
I am what's after this life
We are the Lords of the Flies
On our own island, we rise

Lot of people say they do what they don't
Never seen you alone in these roads
Thirty in my pack like a cartridge I blow
On the shoulder of the mighty river going with the flow (ah)
Wait, where I go, I just do what I want (want)
Like whoop there it is, ain't nobody gonna tell me shit (no)
No more scrapping for the rent (rent)
No more stealing for some shit (shit)
I was always in some shit
And I swear I'd never admit
That I needed a change of pace to really go and arrange
My life in some sort of order that doesn't result in pain (what?)

I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own

They stop all the bickering when I step in the picture
Like the scene only pretty when I give it permission
The flowers, they only grow if I decide to let them
Forever progressing never did listen to what they tell us
I built me an Echo Chamber so I can hear my anger
It's coming in loud and clear if I open there will be danger
I am cautious with every being, don't matter if you're a stranger
I wave in my own reflection, like how do you do my neighbor

I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own

Ride slow, ride slow, ride slow, ride slow
Take the desolation, you can't be still calling on the phone
Our planet all (calling, calling)
I know if I run into the fog
I know if I run into the fog
Say you got cut off, say you got cut off

I don't get along with nobody, no
I think I need a planet of my own
I don't get along with nobody, no

I2I, power line live
I want to fly, Lenny Kravitz never lied
I want to get away somewhere out of sight
Maybe just then everything will pan out alright
It's the hundred pack smoking blunt roller creepin' up behind you
Thought I'd knock you off on the off chance I despise you
Not one to be lied to, quick to press rewind, you
End up where you were before your birth, now don't you cry, you
Already on ten bitch, so don't aggravate
Up to here is where I've had it, great, now thin ice what you skate
I will locate all my pain, corral it into my veins
Push that up into my brain, danger mode is now engaged
Soulbound rare drop every time we drop shit
You need props like Carrot Top to get your wits about you
Every single atom that is me will say it doubts you
Looking around at humans like this place would be better without you
The whole scene is a disgrace, rather distaste-
-Ful, to say the least, they'll do the most to get paid
I know money's needed, but what happened to the days
Of saying "Fuck these labels" to "I hope they pick me"?
I hate to see potential being flushed down the drain
But natural selection is beautiful when you wait

Weed yourself out, bitch, weed yourself out
SESH to the death of me, bruh

Razor in my motherfucking trench coat
Timothy the Tool Man Taylor
Never see my face like I live next door
Equipped, one click and I'm ready to swiftly let this vest blow
Better get back when I let it go
Dead man's switch in active mode
Motherfucker talk a lot of shit (ah)
Till I reach through the mist and they flip (ah)
Flee from the scene not a word plead the fifth
You don't see Bones but he see you bitch (ah)
You are not alone, I can feel your breath
Summon me from ash maybe I will let you live
The legend of the underground tell you what it is
To land in the sky leaping out of the abyss

Dying slow, dying slow, eyes low, eyes low
Repeat the phrase I love you until I turn into a ghost
Dying slow, dying slow, eyes low, eyes low
Repeat the phrase I love you until I turn into a ghost

BONES on the block again, now they on the asphalt
Soon as I get to snappin', I don't just pass I overlap y'all

Feeling like Avril Lavigne the way this shit so complicated
Smothered by my own anger, really got to switch up my cadence
I'm always in need of balance I'll never say that I have it
Anytime you see my eyes be aware of what's inside them
It's a wrap if you act, react on attack
Corpse hands on your neck, chills dash up your back
Fears overflow your vision, stripped of all your intuition
Shut your eyes, click your heels, but I'm not here to grant no wishes

I'm the change in the weather
Whether that's worse or better
I'm the change in the weather
I think today you'll need a sweater
What?

Looking into the mirror and I don't see shit
It's the cashed white myth from the 517 sticks
Boots say TeenWitch, mud stuck to the grip
Bag zipped, blade tucked, cargos stuffed to the brim
Now anytime you hear a clock tick call me Mr. Blunt Twist
Step up to the deadboy, that's how you get done quick
Done with, I'm yelling cut action if you actin tough
Set the sirens off, you hear the tone like I ain't picking up
Never will there ever be some others on our level
Try to throw some dirt on SESH and Bones will quickly grab the shovel
Fuck a muzzle, speaking ruckus, tonight you will sleep in rubble
I got something, fuck some muscle, you will disintegrate if I touch you

I got brand new dope, make it last
And for my next trick, I will turn this blunt to ash
I got brand new dope, make it last
And for my next trick, I will turn this blunt to ash

TeamSESH, 2017 until infinity
People change up quick while I'm still begging for a different me
Fuck up out my Z-O-N-E with that, "Hey, remember me?" (ah)
When I needed help you watched me crawl and struggle on my knees

Now how does it feel to wake up inside a world
Being you, knowing I am right here (right here)

Once I hit you with that backspace, you ain't comin' back
Ctrl + Alt + Delete you, give me space like tab
Once I hit you with that backspace

Used to be on Booth St., seeing 2D
Now we do 3, 1080 HD
Go press the AC, yelling like it hate me
When the sun start screaming, I let my ice save me
I put it on and my temperature dropping
Father time diamonds, press pause and they stop ya'
Cryogenic pendants, I'ma be the last fossil
Now for my next trick I will die proper
Loaded my duffel with these blades and they just got polished
Thinking 'bout the day bring me nothing but solace
Runnin' up with that, fuck it, I’m glad that I left my baggage
They all asked if it happened, replied with laughter
Never one to banter, I wanna up the ante
Every day I take the standard and put it where they can't see
Forever where they can't be, never understand me
I'd rather be the one they hate than the one they think is friendly
Dot zip the competition if there ever was any
Drag to the trash, ash, then I right-click empty
You can't edit this body, all these layers are locked away
Told them System 32 is something they don’t need to operate
System's frozen, now everybody hate me
Nothing new to me, I’m used to it thankfully
Reboot text, yes, you can all thank me
I am the virus that got your heart racing

Once I hit you with that backspace, you ain't comin' back
Ctrl + Alt + Delete you, give me space like tab
(Once I hit you with that backspace, you ain't comin' back
Ctrl + Alt + Delete you, give me space like tab)
Once I hit you with that backspace, you ain't comin' back

For me there ain't no finish, I get it then I replenish
I get up and I go get it while you sitting in the dirt like
How he do that? Bones, why you do that?
Always high, never hiding
That knife, it hop off my body
I let it fly if you doubt it
It will add some miles to your mileage, I make it go
But you knew that, but you knew that
It's the graveyard legend, they say that they independent
But they went and hired suits for business, booking, etcetera
It's the ultimate contradiction, I love how they got conviction
Result of false belief in self, it's time to hem up their britches
They swear that they're something different
It's time to hold up the mirror (yeah)

New edition like the calendar say '88
Matte black trench coat with the razor straight
Make ya drop and give me 20 like Major Payne

Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Now I need a pack just to help me relax
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Looking at the map, only way to know where I'm at
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Now I need a pack just to help me relax
Ever since we came up, don't know how to act
Looking at the map, only way to know where I'm at

Close the doors and quickly, I'm calling order
I'm swiftly when I'm recording, distorted until the morning
I'm flowing, it's kinda hard when you mourning
Don't disregard it, you're with me forever, promise you
Memories never tarnish, the second I heard you calling
Time I thought we have more of
Life reminds you seconds that we got are always going
All is unimportant when you lose someone important
Cannot render thoughts, let alone the words to export them

Can you stand the rain?

Creep up, touch anybody
Panting like I been jogging
Run up, no talking 'bout it
You think we straight, I doubt it
Doubt it, doubt it, you know I doubt it
Doubt it, doubt it, you know I doubt it

I don't give a fuck

You are the same as everyone out
Only the weak take the popular route
Feel like you popping 'til we come around
Get a big head when they bumping your sound
Think you untouchable up until now
Skeleton touch will make you turn around
Vanish now, where do you think I am now?
Evaporate, rise up turn into a cloud
Never seen you when the rain coming down
I touch every drop before it touches the ground

I'm real, J. Lo, Ja Rule
They don't do it like I do
I'm real, J. Lo, Ja Rule
They don't do it like I do

Check it out guys, it's your man
Burning the voicebox in the fucking underground and we're back here
You know what I mean, I can't wait to fucking wrap my hands on this new Bones project called Unrendered
You already know man, straight from the fucking underground, you know what I mean?
You know, every now and then he drops that singing pussy shit but we can get past that as long as he keeps dropping those bangers
(Yo, if you're listening to this Bones, stop with the pussy shit)
Aye man, keep dropping those fucking bangers and we're gonna keep showing up man, know what I mean? Gotta give us that real shit, dawg

Stars up in the sky and both of the windows down
In the pickup, picking up some more from the corner, no use in running out
Never had money but I had a lot of doubt
Still got it, no matter how many people shout
I get freaked when I think about deep time, now I'm weak
I think every storm's a dream as we watch the world sleep
Trying to think too hard 'bout the matter that lies outside your reach
What makes you truly think our brains can fathom what it truly means to think?
Is it a reaction or is it just an outcome?
Like my life without selling one album
A lot of things changed since my life back Howell
Had to make use of my hours
Had to make use of my minutes, had to make use of my seconds

Ride low
Ride low
Ride low
Ride low
Ride low

The rest of the game got me going "ha" like Juvie
Since I dropped the block been hot, no cooling
Rent flexing, spreading, stunting fake jewelry
No those ain't diamonds never me that you foolin'

It's 1997
Rock like Stairway to Heaven
I be at the top waitin'
Like somebody double dared me
When you never did it before
Sometimes it's funny when you fo-cus on the people you know
Watch them react as you grow
Shit will never get old to me
I'm ingrained in the program you see
Even when I go, I don't leave
When I stop breathin I'll still be right here
Turn around if you need me
Some words, some company
Still got that blade under me
Layin' down but no, I don't sleep
My eyes open, hopin' someone notice
I am the only one
Awake when they ain't but
That's something that can't be done
If no one's around to hear it
Do it ever truly happen?
Says who? Light the blunt
Flick the ash and say exactly

I don't pop Xanax because pills are for pussies
Never scared of being human
I ain't 'fraid of feeling feelings
Got that anger, got that razor
Careful, do not run into it
With the team smokin' mean
I just hope we run into ya (wait)
Nobody special, that's me
Cut off your flow, now you got gangrene
You hit the floor like they got that beam
But I don't need a bullet to leave 'em dead at the scene
I conquer, stompin', mobbin', proper
Made my own world like J.K. Rowling
SESH never stop while the rest stay stallin
Ever since we started every day, it get larger

The rest of the game got me going "ha" like Juvie
Since I dropped the block been hot, no cooling
Rent flexing, spreading, stunting fake jewelry
No those ain't diamonds never me that you foolin'

I don't think for a second
That you know what you're doing
I don't think for a second
That you know what you're doing
When you are an individual
You're young, you make shitty rap music, you take pills
You're going to have the body of a geriatric patient
By the time you're fucking twenty-five
It's gonna be fucking hilarious
I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think
#
If I forgot what I knew, then I would be just like you
To live in such ignorance must be a blessing, if I were you, fuck, I'd be over the moon
If I forgot what I do, then I would still look for the truth
Whether it's painting or gardening, I would find happiness within any route
I hope you get money to spend and think that it's good 'til the end
Then realizations, they knock at your door when you don't got no choice but to go let 'em in

Like a bad dream
Like a bad dream

Case sensitive, re-enter
You're my lifeline, I just hope you answer
Been buffering, still loading
Bare with me, this should just take a moment
I know you know I notice
You are the greater of my focus
Gaussian blur if it's not you
Don't wanna see a scene without you

Bones logging on, blunt guts in my palm
On my pixelated lawn, I lag out then respawn
Seems like they create a player then just long to be known
Little do they know every second we're closer to the unknown
I don't need no Glock up on my waist, I don't need no you killing the game
I don't need no why you dont fuck with them, bitch, don't make me explain
Now the whole game hate me and I can understand
I would hate me too if I was any other man, what?

Case sensitive, re-enter
You're my lifeline, I just hope you answer
Been buffering, still loading
Bare with me, this should just take a moment
I know you know I notice
You are the greater of my focus
Gaussian blur if it's not you
Don't wanna see a scene without you
#
You're hard not to notice oh lend me your focus
I've never seen eyes like yours
I want to go inside them climb up high and dive in
I've never felt love like yours
You got what I want, every tick of the tock
I got what you need, every night of the week
You got what I want, every tick of the tock
I got what you need, every night of the week

You know I want you
I want you every night of the week
Fingers through your hair
Oh it feels so right, don't you leave me tonight
#
Fuck a diamond in the rough, throw it back in the dirt
Told the voices in my head to take a hike and it worked
Now there are days I feel so clear I see through solid objects
I see the front yard from the kitchen, neighbors think I'm walling
Yelling that you balling, ah, is that what you call it?
I call it how I see it, all I see is nothing
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it go
(BoyOhBoy) I could never let it... Bones
#
Whether it's dark or the sky is lit up
Whatever the time if my eyes open I get up
If you are not helping me, I do not wanna hear, wait up
You were asleep every night that I stayed up
Time steady passing, it's hard to keep my balance
I know thinking's normal but I over thought to the point of damage
Cannot reverse it, DNA, cursed
Every 24 hours, curl and twist these blunts like cursive
Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go

Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go
Tightrope walker, world down below
Watch your breath and your step, for if you don't, you'll go

Minor setback nightmares never go on vacation
I need a second to breathe, my lungs are waiting for confirmation
Unrendered
#
No good for my health, not good to myself, I am no use to anyone
Rip my eyes out, throw them down, once they hit the ground no seeing you now
Now I can only trust my reaction, gotta learn to walk without ending up in traffic
Lights off just staring at the wall, cut to me, lights on, just nobody home

I'm shaking, I'm panicking, seconds I'll never get back
'Cause I threw 'em away like some evidence
Ready for reckoning, smoking, no questioning
Juice in the mason, make calls like I'm checking in
Look at the burial, see the resemblance
Between myself and the ones who I've ended
Hope it's to me that they pay no attention
Shoo 'em away to my dungeon I vanish
Deadboy, I could never ever stop, no
Yelling underground but you making pop songs
I could lie and say you got something going on
But since day one, bitch, you got it all wrong
Always living in contrast and trying to compare
Wish they could feel okay in the skin they wear

Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this
Stomp you in some shoes I ain't drop yet
Eyes drop to the floor, I'm a hot mess
I scream into the night like stop this
(Every time I do some shit I'm like let's drop this)

It's you and me, baby, first things first, these blunts are waiting
I'm impatient, anxious, hoping I can get an answer
You've always known exactly what to say to make it better

James Stewart, dangerous, got no angels saving us
Jumping off the bridge into 20 below water
Use to get good sleep now every night's a nightmare
Don't do what I did, you will be sorry, I swear
There is never a day that I feel indifferent
Feel indifferent
Feel indifferent

There will never be a time that I am (What? What)
If all goes according to plan (What? What?)
There will never be a time that I am (What? What?)
If all goes according to plan (What? What?)
There will never be a time that I am (What? What?)
If all goes according to plan (Wait)

It's you and me, baby, first things first, these blunts are waiting
I'm impatient, anxious, hoping I can get an answer
You've always known exactly what to say to make it better

Make it "good time" all the time
Make it "good time" all the time

Uh... Okay, guys, it's Vernon, the voicebox of the underground
You know what? Emotional Bones is the best Bones
You know what, man? In second thought, I don't even like rap music. That singing shit, that's, that's, it really hits home
Yeah, learn something new everyday

(Reversed speaking)

[Song when played in reverse]:
I can't say that everything will be okay
I am a disgrace
Don't look at my face, I am a disgrace
I don't know what will happen
I am a disgrace
My uncle used to play drums in a rock band
#
I don't need to clutch a TEC, I don't need a cup of tech
All I need's to see the moon rise and the sun to set
All I need is a nest in the woods where I can rest
Branches tappin on my window, birds wake me up to SESH
Consider that C4 on my chest if you really coming up trying to press
Take you with me on the wildest ride you've ever been on yet
Out this world, off this globe, back into what we don't know
What we never will, no matter the rate that human knowledge grows

Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down

I delete you then creep, will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Can't call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
I ain't Kim Possible
I delete you then creep will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Like trying to sleep while you in the street
Because you made a vow you would watch the moon

I don't got a lot of time so I'll keep it short
I step in like poppa's home
Kids, it's time to take down them forts
Because all I'm seeing is a mess now
I think it's best if you step down
Heard a little voice that said my set loud
Fuck everybody else, it's all about SESH now
You can have later but now it's about us, I said
You can have later but now it's about us

I delete you then creep, will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Can't call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
I ain't Kim Possible
I delete you then creep will you ever see me?
No, it's damn near impossible
Like trying to sleep while you in the street
Because you made a vow you would watch the moon
#
Who do it every day? Bones
You are so not in my league, no
I bring it back for the team, oh
Every time that I leave home
Bring that 400 degrees, die then cryogenically freeze
To them, it's the same, but it's different to me
My pattern of breath is like waves in the sea
If they ever leave, I promise you'd see
The things you don't notice are things that you need
There's not too much things that get to me
Other than light when it leak through the trees
One look into my eyes will not peek into me
Need more than your vision to feel what I be
Quick to yell action, know SESH make a scene
If you need an edit, I'll cut you then leave

Got you some money now, got you a manager, but you still ain't shit
Think that the tables have turned for you but, bitch, you still ain't this
Nothing of substance, speak about nothing
I get on shit and I run it like Runyon
TeamSESH scum come straight from the dungeon
No matter where you go, hear my voice, stop running

Say that you counting and cooking up
Bitch, you just fraudulent and fucking up, ayy

Loaded up, no buffering, I can play offline, I don't need connections (No)
Go count your blessings, you don't get somewhere just 'cause you wanna get there
Dreams don't get granted (What?), prayers don't get answered
It ain't no question if I got wraps, you know I'ma roll 'em (You know I'ma roll 'em)
Always too cashed to ever get mad, come on, get to know me (Come on, get to know me)
It ain't no question if I got wraps, you know I'ma roll 'em (You know I'ma roll 'em)

What's it gonna be, like Janet and Busta?
Not trying to impress you, just don't wanna press you
You know it's no pressure
When it's me and you it's auto connection
I made my life hectic, I'm used to the stressing
Without you I'm cold but with you convected


What?
Trying to live a modern life like Rocco
Please don't disturb, swerve strangers like potholes
Had to take it further, I ain't settling for condos
Had the secret sauce so I blew up like mondo burger
Earn it, watch to fuckin' learn it
I don't think I'm hot, I just know the dope burning
Like it never did, so that should say something
3 years ago, smoking stems in abundance

Brick wall, waterfall, mirror mirror on the wall
Who fucking got it all? SESH, yes
Brick wall, waterfall, mirror mirror on the wall
Who fucking got it all? BONES, yes

#
Hit the dope, then I go like Otto Rocket
We do it large, they Polly Pocket
Venue never big enough for the block
It's hard to stop, I could never slow up
Up against a white wall, I don't show up
Ask about interests, I know none
But breathing every day some way or another
The dash to the grave is the one I fell in love with
Lay my corpse down, but don't you dare weep
When it's time for me to sleep, wrap me up in organic sheets
Light me, give the world heat
When I'm gone, look at me as meat, feed me to the animals
In terms of doing, it's the least I could do after all

We never gave a fuck about them
So why would they give a fuck about us?
We never gave a fuck about them

Mr. Emil Gower: I owe everything to George Bailey. Help him, dear Father
Giuseppe Martini: Joseph, Jesus, and Mary. Help my friend, Mr. Bailey
Ma Bailey: Help my son, George, tonight
Bert: He never thinks about himself, God, that's why he's in trouble
Ernie Bishop: George is a good guy. Give him a break, God
Mary: I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight

George Bailey I'm wishing on it daily
But I don't get the luxury of visions of my vanquish
I'm stuck assuming it's fine
Smoke in my eyes burn my retina make me blind
Everything in line hold my breath then I dive
100 story drop until my brain's offline
I power down just to restart again
100 tabs lost, wait, now what was I sayin'
What I was thinkin' I feel so much better now
My favorite joke is life because it's "us" it's based around
What I was thinkin' I feel so much better now
My favorite joke is life because it's "us" it's based around

I always get a laugh out of it in the end
I hope you understand because I know I...Always got it fuck the profit I do this for nothing
You so off your shit still actin like you onto something
You don't bring a splash of difference to the scenery
You are doomed to be the one that never finds the missing piece

Good luck you're gonna need it (what, what, what, what)
Good luck you're gonna need it (what, what, what, what)
Good luck you're gonna need it (what, what, what, what)
Good luck you're gonna need it (what, what, what, what)

Clarence: You sent for me, sir?
Senior Angel: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help
Clarence: Splendid. Is he sick?
Senior Angel: No worst. He's discouraged
...
Clarence: Sir, if I should accomplish this mission, I mean... um. Might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir, and people ARE beginning to talk
Senior Angel: What's that book you've got there?
Clarence: Oh, oh, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
Senior Angel: Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey and you will get your wings
Clarence: Oh, thank you, sir, thank you

BONES

SESH forever on the rise
Let the moon be my guide
Staring at the sky while I navigate
My way through the divide I find
I have learned that nothing's pre-determined
Truthfully I speak the sermon
Stand behind this world observing
Watch you watch them while they burn it

I am nothing but a corpse to you
I am nothing but a corpse to you
I could never change that
I can never change back
I could never change that
I can never change back
(What, what, what, wait)

I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me
I know, I know, I know, I know it, no need to tell me

Whoever say they do it hasn't ever seen me do it, that's just apparent
I hate myself, I agree that's a sentiment that we sharing
You should never be content with your shit
Matter of fact, you should be embarrassed
Let me clarify for the camera:
Bones don't acknowledge negative gestures (What?)
I don't reply to knock off banter
No, I don't drink if it's not organic
No, I don't smoke if it's not outstanding
Bitch, I been cashed too many years in the basement
Impossible to face me, the dark made me faceless
A cold white hand coming out the vast blankness
Me, I'm only seen when I wanna see their faces
Years worth of hits, what you sittin' on ain't shit

Pack up the flows, head out on the road, do as many shows (Wait)
As you can 'cause I promise time will go (Wait)
Faster than you've ever seen it before (Wait)
Goodbye to the seconds, farewell to the minutes
Today you were found, tomorrow you're missing
Today you were found, tomorrow you're missing, what?

SESH, bitch
[?], bitch
BONES

You know that I see through ya
You know there's nobody you foolin'
Bones on the hunt again and I don't know just how he's planning to do ya
You know I'll eventually find you
You know I've always been the kind to hold onto grudges
And keep them inside until these planets collide (Wait)

Fuck what you heard unless you heard it from me ('less you heard it from me)
We don't deserve a thing let alone a chance to breathe ('lone a chance to breathe)
Fuck what you heard unless you heard it from me ('less you heard it from me)
We don't deserve a thing let alone a chance to breathe

Fuck your dreams I’m worried about ours
I will never go back to crowbars to cars
You could walk a million yellow bricks never reach oz
You could part the clouds never see God
Metaphor to trying too hard to reach Bones
Except I’m really here bring fear to your home
Me I always hear like my ear to the phone
So listen for the static Imma warn you in code
Think you will understand if you see me up close no
You can never truly know a ghost

Talk slang on the corner but you don’t
Speakin down on the team bitch you won't
Take it easy slow it down let it go
Fuck it maybe I’ll feel the same we will never know
Never know how long I would have gone
I would have passed on if I was still on backroads

Ride like McBride Arthur in his prime in the parry near the tides
Focus extra high so my gauge is always bright enough to light the path
And give directions to whomever brave enough
The chance nobody has taken up the one nobody dared to love
Don’t become the thing you hated just because you’re hating us
And that’s just words from the wall I awake translate it all
Then I scrape the message off
#
It's the creep from the creek, skeleton man, show my teeth
The whole world turn away from me, swing my hair till I RIP
I watch 'em jump, jump, jump, but they'll never get as high as us
You know that I'm sorry, never meant to do it to 'em
Fuck all that talking though, we do what we came to do
Every time it's not a surprise we fuck up the scene including you

Keep running after them dividends
Your whole corner made up of yes men
Convinced yourself that you're a different man
Like if I run up on you, I need different hands
Complied for bland, can't stand a chance
Save it like the last dance, just advance
Think you going ham like Vance, but you Francis Buxton
See me now, they probably say fuck him
When they get home they probably bump him
Every single day, can't get away
From the four letters, S E S H
Bathe in your hate, I drink your tears
Straight from the ducts to the cup, say cheers
Creep on the street, make it sleet when I leer
Take your vocal cords out, now they won't hear
I don't want what the rest do, I just wanna let you
Know skeleton man is on the loose and he's coming to get you

It's the creep from the creek, skeleton man, show my teeth
The whole world turn away from me, swing my hair till I RIP
I watch 'em jump, jump, jump, but they'll never get as high as us
You know that I'm sorry, never meant to do it to 'em
Fuck all that talking though, we do what we came to do
Every time it's not a surprise we fuck up the scene including you
#
While you wake up and get your cake up
Bitch I lay up while I pick my poison
Rolling while you going out
And showing why they should adore you
Hope that you get all the fame
Dance around on top the stage
Get everything you dreamed
Then tell me "Bones, it just don't feel the same"
You still get soaked in the rain
Money don't exclude you from pain
Fame ain't nothing but a single syllable that we use to say
"Known by some people, but not known truly either"
Thinking you know me from a song
Is like summing up someone from a voicemail
No rhymes, no time codes
Could keep me inside my rhythm
Never needed 'em, I'm conceited
Blunts die every time I hit 'em

Hold up let me get myself together
Hold up let me get myself together
#
Turn the page like Segar
Wrapping up my cigar
Reporting live from the ER
I'm going under like "see ya"
You smiling like Moesha
Light the pilot light, then go heat 'em
No heater on me, no Nina
I don't click-clack, let alone even see ya
Tell 'em go home like Roger
Forty-four blunts and now I'm off it
Pour that four up and get nauseous
Follow the leader like you gonna prosper
Fuck your pockets, got no logic
To your project of nonsense
I hate that hate will grow inside me
Till I'm rendered unconscious

Okay, do not look to me for a lifeline
I only know of one and it's all mine
Okay, do not look to me for a lifeline
I only know of one and it's all mine
#
Some days better than others, yeah, I agree
Other days, I forget I'm lucky I can breathe
Weird how it works, how the wheels, they turn
Me to roadkill when I'm hopping off the curb
Misplace words with a distinct verb
Now you feel like you do something for the world
Sorry to say, but we blew that chance
The last of the grains gone, no more sands
Now we stand as the trap door opens
Slowly we fall where eternity closes
We just wanna find a direction to point a finger
And say "It's not mine, it's yours"
Permanent cycle is branded within
From a seed to a tree, always know what you is
Support what supports you
It's up to you, do what you want to do
Hopefully, you give back to the roots
Give back to the roots

I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
I'll never know, no, no
(I will never know)
I'll never know, no, no
(I will never know)
I'll never know, no, no
(I will never know)
I'll never know, no, no

That would be great

Never thought about it, but when you say it like that
All of the gears they start to spin in my head
Never understood why they all acting like that
But I guess I do know that you said it like that
You can go out, I think I'll stay in instead
So with that said, don't ask me how we did it
"You're a genius, you really are. You're a genius"
"I know"
Never thought about it, but when you say it like that

I think I'm gonna stay right here
Give a fuck about no one, no one
I think I'm gonna stay right here
Give a fuck about no one, no one

Welcome back, Bones

Iced out skull heads, '06 Juelz
Runnin when I'm comin like oh shit the 12
Said I'd never be where I'm at right now
See a wall first thing I say is stand back, pow
You fucked up now I been fucked up forever
Head full of spiders shake and watch em' all scatter
Proof is in the pudding we know how to mix the batter
Try to replicate the recipe and ruin every platter
Coming through move out I know what you do now
Wake up hate me act like you cool now
When you talk shit just watch who you cool around
Dirty how your crew will be when there is not a "you" around
And that's just facts and if you don't like that
And that's just facts and if you don't like that

You can see me bout it
You can see me if you wanna talk about it
You can see me bout it
You can see me if you wanna talk about it

"I ain’t no spring chicken, I don’t have to tell you that
I’ve been sitting in this same, damn, casino all my life
Listening to all those bells going off for everybody else, but nothing ever hits on my machine, not even once
I’m still sitting there with the same drink in my hand, good old American dream"

I fall down, and then, I get up again
I don't know when it ends, I don't know if it will
I just hope that it's all, all part of the thrill
'Cause my heart is beating fast and I don't think I can breathe
Can't breathe

Where do your happy thoughts go when you need them
Where do your happy thoughts go when you need them

I'm running out of words to say
I hope that you'll work with me and wait for it
I think I'm getting better now
It's all coming back to me

Where do your happy thoughts go when you can't find them
Where do your happy thoughts go when you need

I'm running out of words to say
I hope that you'll work with me and wait for it

Searching for file

Always talk about money, like it mean something you way too funny
Hope you get it in abundance spend it like you want it
Go and tell me how you does it
Salute me R.I.P. Stack Bundles
See me play now they calling for a huddle
I don't fight I don't get into a tussle
I don't ever gotta flex no muscle
Adrenaline running around my tracks
No don't tell Bones to relax
My feet up reclining rewinding to the day that we scrapped that cab
3 A.M, snow on the grass
3:06, we made them tracks
Don't know how we made it back its a fact that all I know's a regretful past

Frostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing
Frostbite, cover my hands up to my face I don't feel a thing
Sitting in the back seat, where we going?
I can't recognize one face anymore
I don't know no one everything foreign
Fuck it all somebody help me out

"I did
I did. l hated having to go through that...
Caring… worrying… the pain…
It's not for me
And you know
It's not like that all ends...
When you're 18 or 21 or 41 or 61
It never, never ends
It's true
There is no end zone
You never cross the goal line
Spike the ball and do your touchdown dance
Never..."

I abuse and confuse my brain
Tell myself I want sun, then I produce rain
Never not knowing where it came
I hold on like I like this pain
My bad choices await to lead me to the grave like, "right this way"
Let me down easy, please don't tease me
When the time's up hearts don't tick neither
Say you got the answers but I don't wanna see em'
Even if you had them still I wouldn't wanna be you

Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
Slow down it's a ride don't rush it
#
Even if I sit here calmly, they don't know what to call me
Everybody has their off days, but I think I have them more than others
My mind's become a bother, I get cold like I got no covers
On the back of the breeze like a leaf, I go wherever the wind blow
I love the places they don't go
I see the faces that don't show
They say they know but not what I know
I know they don't, I'm sure

Mr. car alarm
Don't step too close
Mr. car alarm
Don't step too close
Sesh

This ain't the first, this ain't the last
I ain't the worst, I ain't the baddest one
I ain't the baddest one
This ain't the first, this ain't the last
I ain't the worst, I ain't the baddest one
I ain't the baddest one

Step back from the vehicle
#
Throwing seeds in the flower bed like three hours in
I been tending before seven left the dream that I was in
Swear on SESH since I was ten, I been fixed to make amends
With the world I felt would hold me back until the very end
I get it I feel it my mind it has no limits
I'm spread across the universe in a million tiny pieces
I'm pixelated thinking while I'm element table drinking
Know these chemicals I'm meddling with will surely be the end of me
I know I see but I cannot change I'm embedded in my ways
I cannot disconnect these waves
I am the puppet master that never cut the strings
Hanging forever this life is just not what it seems
Riding in a chariot made of other things
Apple turn to buggy roaches turn to human beings
Fireflies turn to lamps field mice turn to horses
Pull my carriage up let me out now I'm nauseous
How could I have ever foretold this?

Two blades on my lap, twin blunts to the neck
I'm the burden on your back, headstone say SESH
Two blades on my lap, twin blunts to the neck
I'm the burden on your back headstone say SESH

I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it

What's the status? Get your math if it ain't adding up
Cross like lattice me, I'm glad to quickly wrap you up
I don't got no other option
I don't got no other option
I was told to get it by mine
So I gotta get it for mine
I was told to get it by mine
So I gotta get it for mine

I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it, I gotta get it

Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?

Hair in my face (face)
Can't see a thing (thing)
Fuck where you at, bitch
Fuck where you came
Young Bones still the same (same)
Blade on my waist (waist)
The day I go and change is when they slide me on the tray
And they slowly push me into flames
Now freeze the frame
Skin melting off my face
Charbroil on my teeth (teeth)
We all get fucked in the end, that's real (real)
We all get burnt by the fire of the kiln (what)
It's popular to talk about popping without a deal
I am guilty but I also speak the truth when I wail
Never distribute music but I'm still paid like I sold
1 mil first week, what is life at this point?
Ready to go and you know this
I don't need no piece with no holster
I don't need to "bang" when I pull it
All I need is words and your focus
But if I can't get that
I will turn right back
To the graveyard god
And take you to just where I be at

Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?
Motherfuck talking bitch
What the fuck you want from me?

Okay, I am nothing valuable and neither are you
The place we live would probably be better if we died by noon
If we died by noon
Okay I am nothing valuable and neither are you
The place we live would probably be better if we died by noon
If we died by noon
Died by noon

Use your inside voice, it's getting late
And I can't sleep
Use your inside voice, it's getting late
And I can't sleep

We have but a moment stuck inside this jar
#
No weapon on my side but I'm still down to ride
Know I stay up for mine forever vertically spine'd
Don't look to me for kindness if you recite me lies
I will cite you with these fines make you pay up every time
I know I say some mean shit but I mean every line
I know I do that scream shit
But I don't wear no mask to hide my face
When I'm out walking down the streets at night

Up in the alleyway
I ain't ever gonna leave
Up in the alleyway
I ain't ever gonna leave
Up in the alleyway
I ain't ever gonna leave
Up in the alleyway
I ain't ever gonna leave

Tell me where the drugs at tell me where it be
Let me know where them drugs at let me know the fee
Tell me where the drugs at tell me where it be
Let me know where them drugs at let me know the fee

Tape in the deck and bitch stay blastin
While the rest leach like plastic
4 or 5 bags in the center console resting
Never run low I know my investments
Fuck your intentions call on your hench man
Never alone cuz you know you fear being stranded
You don't understand you could travel the land
Find an island to hide in and i will turn to sand
My chemical makeup it was a miscalculation
Our constellation and my making has proven no correlation
I gotta face it

This is the part where you feel like nothing
Everything is shit coming down from above you
This is the part where you feel like nothing
Everything is shit coming down from above you
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine
I don't got no time so you cannot have mine

Smoking packs designing boots
Nowadays I like the truth
I remember a time I found it hard to find
Any grain of truth that I wasn't doomed
Rode the loop for like a second or two
Hopped off the track fell down and found a new
Look out below geronimo I came out of nowhere they don't know what for
They approaching like a crash site smoking from the impact
I emerge blown out light behind me cast a silhouette
They don't know what to expect assumptions get confirmed
I'm a mess sunny days turn to dark when I flip this hour glass
#
Dumb white fuck, scum from the jump
Trash from the dump, every limb stay numb
35 blunts and the sun ain't up
I don't need to rush and you ain't gotta wait up
Either way, uhm, I'ma make way up while you coming to the finish
You will see me splitting ribbons, really wish that they were kidding
When they say that I be killin' but they mean it, bitch
I put it down, you couldn't even leave it, couldn't lay it, I'm archaic
I'm the fire in the basement, I'm the bomb in the attic
I'm your heart when it's racing, Stone Cold theme song when I really get it going
Mick Foley car crash, droppin' like Owen
RIP to the blue fucking blazer
And fuck the people behind the scenes that didn't make sure it was safer
#
Flashbacks of coming up they hit me like a tow truck
Feeling too much like even the moon got a motive
Sometimes when you look around you might see no one
Till you get in motion and now they wanna know you
I wish I could say that I'm surprised
I wish I could say it's not on my mind
Ctrl alt delete it disappear then come back creeping
Hardly seen but every season SESH create a whole new scenery
If you don't believe in me hope you stay tuned to see
The cosmos working I'm the nothing that is everything

I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life happens for me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life lives through me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life happens for me
I don't hope and I don't dream
I just watch as life lives through me

I don't hope
I don't dream

Still will kill, bitch, cuz I don't speak for real
Keep it quiet you would never see it coming till you feel
Buck knife to your spine, run it quickly to the sky
Open you just like a letter, let me read just what's inside
Like its mail time, mail time, hit the Alpine
Now we bumpin', smokin' blunts, get to it like its bout time
In and out of route, time pit stop to count mine
I need every decimal essential for this ounce I'm bankin' on
Cashin' off, you show out, I laugh it off, you go out, I stay at home
Still your funds is lookin'  low, I ain't one to give a fuck about a couple dollars
But I know you are so tell me how the fuck you plan to pile up
If you wilder than the wildest that would be me lets be honest
So just take your 2nd rank and take your silver to get polished
Shadow box it make it gorgeous, put it on the wall to worship
Only thing I frame is progress for me, that's a perfect portrait
Everybody dressing up and doing all their best impressions
Oh, so many Bones imitations, I'ma start a convention
All your shows look like dashcon stage, like a ball pit
Under developed brain somehow stuck inside some tall kids
Fuck about your talking and your posting, keep it going
It's final cut the way, they over saturate their own shit
If they wanna know you  you just one click away
If they wanna get to Bones, that's just something they'll have to dream

Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
They got money that's lovely
Cuz I got shit I been wantin'
Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
They got money that's lovely
Cuz I got shit I been wantin'
Got some woods in the duffel
Got some blades just to touch em
You got money? That's lovely

I swear that I'ma shine for a century
From the outside peekin' in like it's meant for me
Looking up at the stars like it's meant to be
Flickin' blunts, watchin' ash fight gravity
Death by dope, I'm a casualty
A walking travesty, I am what's bad for me
Came up from the sewer, got trash in me
Ever since I came in and changed the game, they been mad at me
64 grams of gold bouncin' off of my neck
Heavy but it's something light, man, it ain't shit but a check
Never sweat rent, I get triple that then I jet
I went my whole life without gettin' paid for shit (What?)

Smoke one blunt then I roll two more
Triple, that's three sparked in a four-door
SESH to the boots, get stomped and abused
'Til my face turn blue, I'm the screw that's loose
Smoke one blunt then I roll two more
Triple, that's three sparked in a four-door
SESH to the boots, get stomped and abused
'Til my face turn blue, I'm the screw that's loose

I be so gone
AFK, going AFK
I be so gone
AFK, going AFK

The fall
I don't know if I will live
The fall
I don't know if I will live
It's all
It's all just a bunch of shit
It's all
It's all just a bunch of shit

I'm falling away
I'm falling away from this world
I'm falling away
I'm falling away from this world
Been crawling away
Been crawling away from this world

Ride along far away
Hope I don't fall away
Hope I don't fall away
Ride along far away

SESH

You ain't slangin stop, I pull up
Parking lots, you ain't arranging rocks, I know that
You think it's hard cause you've seen it done
Slash heard, you're a sponge, never be your own
Man, can't you understand how I came in the game?
Yeah me neither, no breathin', it's amazing I make
My way out the other side of my personal maze
I was stuffed for a minute, couldn't feel my legs
I had to bounce, back, like the rubber band snap
Round the ziplock bag full of money that we stashed
In the wall downstairs, that was back in 2010
I was just about to leave, no one knew just how to feel
But I did, that's why I wait and feel
Calm inside cause I am real
I am me and you are you
Running around tryin' to chase this loot
Hop straight back in and then I glist to the finish
White noise in the flesh, hair down, never see me
I done tried to make it clear, I do not think that they hear me
Mic check, 1, 2,  Ri-ri-rick in the building
Got my hi-vis and my blade look like I'm building
On the site with my clipboard, smoking and chilling
No hard hat, no whistle, still officially killing
Every fucking working brain within a arms length distance
You get melted into ashes and I'm casting you to iron
Turn you to a blade of mine, so I can use your life in spite
I make cash all night, fuck your money and your ice
You ain't helping nobody with the shitty words you write

Think about it
Think about it
Think about it
Think about it

Better l-l-l-listen, You sound l-l-like bitches
No, I don't br-bring no business, I just s-say what I'm thinking
While you straight flip for some digits, bitch I stay right here up in it
I'm at a sector you can't reach, 'less you been bor-born up in it
We-we be on the natives, talk they can't understand us
The dialect run much deeper than geography planet
Do not think that they get it, matter of fact I'm for certain
Show no respect for the planet, then look confused when it hurts you
Know I keep that 42 on me like my name's Jackie Robinson
Know I keep my composure real calm, but deep inside it's apocalypse
Any time, any day, you just gotta let me know
Any shade on the sundial, SESH ready to go
Any time, any day, you just gotta let me know
Any shade on the sundial, SESH ready to go
I'ma shut your eyes, I-I'ma send you off right
I'ma shut your eyes, I-I'ma send you off right
Looking in the mirror, and I can't see a thing
The curse of the ghost, I carry it 'til I lay
Throw some trash in my grave just to prove it's the same
Twisting in space, do you choose to complain
'Bout the littlest minuscule shit, you stuck on that middle school shit
Yappin' like a bitch until one day, know you gotta get hit
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like this, this, it's like that y'all

Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck
Put 'em up if you want, I ain't never gave a fuck

Tombstone flooded with diamonds up on my neck
Just to glisten, pour the mix shit, then I went and spent your rent
I'm a scumbag baby, shoulda never gave me money
We came in with no help, we don't owe nobody
Split the earnings with my team, then we go and do another
Don't ask me about no list, I don't know nobody
Skinny white piece of shit, don't you ever forget
Had cuts on my hands from aluminum cans
Had rust in my lungs from the dump I was in
Had dreams I convinced myself I'd never get
Now I'm the dream catcher, now life caught my attention
You still ignore the seconds, years thrown away for nothing
So now I gotta double up, fuck that shit I'll triple up
I outdo what they have done, double lap and trip them up
I ain't with the listen up, rather you not fuck with me (yeah)
You and your music is a joke that's never not funny to me

Thanks for the fucking laughs dickhead, (what?) fuckin' pussy

Biodegradable bags, they all be fading so fast
One week you the hottest then the next they don't know where you're at
Like you disappear but you're still here though
Still doing the same shit nobody care about
You broke rule number one
Can't find real treasure in a spot already dug

What is his name? Who is he?
Art Vandelay
Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
That's your boyfriend
What does he do?
He's an importer
Just imports? No exports?
He's an importer-exporter. Okay?

I just need to know, tell me right now
Just give me the go, I'ma break it down
If you're ready to go, you're not around
I will be here forever, for you now, now, now, now

Juice from the farmers market, dope from up the street
Non pasteurized drinking, smoking filthy, sipping clean
It's the scumbag boy crawling out the garbage sheet
Spastic mind, flip on that dime, I got problems you don't need
Exaggerated shoe soles, walking like a moon man
Haven't been to earth in some time you could assume hands
Full of new stones, 'bout to chisel out some tombs man
Worry-free, don't look to Bones with drama, I don't do that
I see them running off with the style that we made like 4 years ago
I'm glad you a fan and can finally feel so useful
Then they leave them starving, SESH give them whole spoons full
Airplane method like a child, runway ready for landing, oh
#
I came here to fuck the game up, now they don't mention me
Petey Pablo when I raise up, now they invest in me
No one can tell your shadow apart from all these other clones
But when they see my silhouette you bet they know its Bones
Deadboy, back up on your head, drop the guillotine
Slanted ways I don't receive, I broadcast what I feel in me
Orson Welles, hope me well
Bout to scare the world and bail
Found the caves that lead to hell, tunnel down to til I was home
Walking on coals, Itching like I'm Tyrone
Know I'm fiending, know I need it, let me into another zone

What do I do with the rest of them?
I don't know, should they live or should they die?
Hold on I know whats best for them
Leave them out in the rain, one night with the team is all we need
What do I do with the rest of them?

Let me start by saying I don't like nobody
Let me start by saying I don't like nobody
I don't fuck with nobody, no I don't fuck with nobody
Let me start by saying I don't fuck with nobody

Bones, Bones, Bones
Bones, Bones, Bones
Wait, wait, wait

Maggots crawling out my ribcage like a trashcan
Smoke leaking out me while I dope, know when I'm cashed damn
Hair tied up, I'm matchin', see piss, my shit hit like Agassi
You make it roll when I do shows, make racket now you mad at me
Acting so up status like that rocket on your back and chest
I will snap right back and rubber band your bank, no charging dip
I pull every card 'til you dissolve and you return to deck
I disarm your arms like when Sub-Zero showed up on the ship
Shoulder lean, young dro, never never too much blunt smoke
Jigging-Jigging to our own shit, motherfuck whoever I don't know
Shoulder lean, young dro, never never too much blunt smoke
Jigging-Jigging to our own shit, motherfuck whoever I don't know

We came in starving so yeah now we eating
Forever hungry say fuck, forever feasting
Fuck what your team say, you ain't the meanest
You ain't the rawest and sure ain't the cleanest
Bitch I step up feeling just like Meryl Streep
I defend my life and protect those around me 'til I sleep

"I'm very well, indeed."
"I think this could be a real masterpiece. This whole record"
"This really, it could be a masterpiece."
"I know it's great, wouldn't it... wouldn't it be great if it hooked in?"
"Easier to rate means that you have a tape now?"
"Yeah they, they, they, they know... there's no playin' around now, okay? No naps, you understand, right? It costs to be in... ground... ground."
"That was great."
"So they won't believe your own death you'll be immortal... (mhmm) go on forever."
"That'd be great." (mhmm)

What?
Sharpen the number 2, rip out some college rule paper
And take down these lessons (lessons)
Eyes on the board if you feel that you're bored and you
Ask me to leave, no I won't let you
I let you in on my mental and I let you
Witness me conduct the lecture (lecture)
You know too much but you truly know little
About this big planet where you have been living
Ash in your brain, must've huffed them away
I knew too many people like you in the day
Day meaning past, and night meaning future
Darkness fall quick but I will never lose you
Up on the hill where I watch
Look down on the place that you call your spot
Up on the hill where I watch
Look down on the place that you call your spot

Tell them that they need to backtrack, back it up
Bones make them backpack flat, pack it up
Back in school used to laugh, laugh, laugh it up
Now they mad when they see buildings getting packed for us
Now I can see everything from here
Found the highest elevation, point and set up camp there
Now I spend my days binded to the purpose of my searching
For the reason that they leaving earth to make a modest purchase
I condemn myself to worthless, rest my eyes until they hurting
Crooked teeth show through the leaves, if you see me don't say a thing
Be completely still, will only hurt a little
The shadows jumping off of me to spell out how I'm feeling

I think its time to let them know
Crack a laugh when I hear you act sad on the low
You could travel the globe, you could rally the shows
But comparing you to me, I'm not having it though
I think its time to let them know
Crack a laugh when I hear you act sad on the low
You could travel the globe, you could rally the shows
But comparing you to me, I'm not having it though

Fuck around and make me lose it
Fuck around and make me move you
Talking like you shooting like movies
You will get cut like bloopers
Fuck around and make me lose it
Fuck around and make me move you
Talking like you shooting like movies
You will get cut like bloopers

Any time, any rhyme, I pick up on every vibe
Come correct like every time, you wait in line we make the line

I don't need your praise, get the fuck up out my space
Hold on I don't need your plays, do not click up on my face
Rather die up on the vine, with every word I got inside
Then disperse myself amongst the world in a fashion I dislike
And I think its about that time, I'ma show the world them fuckin' rhymes
How you pass away deep down inside, found a new plot with a brand new life
Got a hundred shoes still I got one knife, get it everyday like I got one night
Though they never act like they got one life, they fucking up every day and just thinking they can

Come back from that
But they can't
And it's sad to me
It's sad to me

Waking up, gotta get my shit together
Trench coat swinging in any weather
Looking at my gold while they search for treasure
Proof is in the pudding, Bones do it better
That don't mean that I'll teach it to ya
That just mean that I'm the reaper to ya
Take you when I please and then I
Leave you with the leaves and let you sleep with nature
#
My head hurt, I need to lie down (Yeah, yeah)
Play me too loud, I need to pipe down
Lights down, my hair is up
My stare is like looking into the fire's eyes
Come around my way and you'll get

Burnt to a crisp like that
Before you even get the chance to fight back
I know what you're thinking
"Why so quick to flip it? Bones, now you always tripping"
No, I'm just fucking sick of clones thinking that they killin' it

Stalactite dripping out your flashlight
Glitching you in flashback transmission
I suppose this is the ending for the story that you call your life
Take the binders, rip the spine, every page is getting burnt
Now every breath you take is mine (What?)

Burnt to a crisp like that
Before you even get the chance to fight back
I know what you're thinking
"Why so quick to flip it? Bones, now you always tripping"
No, I'm just fucking sick of clones thinking that they killin' it

Relax
It's light up time

Cashed motherfucker dropping straight out of the 517
With the team that you know don't play
Graveyard villain let's get it, I'ma get it
If you look into the darkness out of nothing you will see me
I'm crawling out the shadow, know it's him like Ville Valo
When you hear that dragging metal, I will carve you like Geppetto
All of you make me fucking sick, swear you doing shit that nobody did
Everything you done I done already did, tell me how many times do we gotta do this
See, it starts with us, then it ends with them
For years it ain't stop, no it never ends
I'm used to the cycle, I'm used to the tendencies
That I get just to do it again

Kill em off, kill em all, every summer
Summer never coming, we hibernate never
Kill em off, kill em all, every summer
Summer never coming, we hibernate never
Kill em off, kill em all, every summer
Summer never coming, we hibernate never

Focus while I'm smoking, where my d-d-d-dope at?

Yo' shit is terrible, shut the fuck up
Talking that back but you never get buck
Say that you out here, bitch, you get no love
Yappin' 'bout stackin' but know it's not much

Fucking with me and all my brothers is curtains
Time to show you what it's like to be worthless
Welcome to my little slice of the journey
Out this cold life, me, I call it a burden
Let me burn, let me burn, fuck an urn
Sprinkle me to Earth, let me blend with the dirt
Biodegradable, I am the fable
The myth from the sticks, pale witch, cold razor
Trying your best to adapt to the fact
That you're stuck in the trap and there's no turning back
Now you just wanna go home
But you'll never get there, you just woke Bones
I be where the black mold grow

Yo' shit is terrible, shut the fuck up
Talking that back but you never get buck
Say that you out here, bitch, you get no love
Yappin' 'bout stackin' but know it's not much

No, it's not much
No, it's not much
No, it's not much

We get the point while you missing it (Yes)
Twisting up my own blunt, sitting in the darkness
I will end your whole shit, pussy, you don't want this
Get the fuck outta here
Back then, I used to scrap all year
Now I do this, pass away in a pit
Resurrect on stage, it's a duel for the depths
Wait, it's the TeamSESH renegade back on the case
Wait, Bones 'bout to tell you what it is and what it ain't
I've been growing, oh-so slowly
Tired of the bullshit the world keep telling me
I just wanna leave, but I know I can't

Lava lamp by the stairs, glowin' while I show you care
I've been here and I've been there but next to you's my favorite here
I don't need choppers and jets to reach the high I ain't been yet
Cause I know that time will tell and so far it's been speaking clear
So far this year's been a good year, so far today's been a good day
I bet tonight's gonna be the same but you never know, so enjoy the breeze
Watch the sky turn and die, flip tonight and tell me why
You choose to focus on some lies that eat your brain, heart and insides
You don't need it, you don't need it, push 'em away
I don't wanna go too far and sink, my hates all flow in my brain
Because it only comes in doses, it ain't truly like the ocean
You show me there's more to living and I hold you and forget I'm hopeless

You are my everything
I need you forever, forever, forever
I need you forever, forever, forever
#
I think it's funny how they change up
Sesh dipped in diamonds, if you go blind then you could blame us
We hit the perfect spot without even aimin'
Shit make me kek thinking about the basement now
No, you don't want to face me now
No, you cannot take the realm that I be in
Promise your ass cannot stand the heat
Let alone actually stand to me
You're not even a man you see
Boy I'ma show you how it is
How you don't finish school
How you ditch what you knew
Die for the first time and start again

Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch, I got the touch that got 'em wildin'
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch, I got the touch that got 'em wildin'

When the circle's running again
Never could you get to us, could you get to us, could you get
When the circle's running again
Never could you get to us, could you get to us

Got that look up on your face like my time's coming soon
I just want to let you know that you couldn't be farther from the truth
And I hope you feel every syllable
I cannot sleep until I know that you know
That you are the worst shit around
I hope you go forever running around
Thinking that you're hard until you can finally realize
That false hopes scurry when you have to carry them

Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch, I got the touch that got 'em wildin'
Timeless, I gotta make it timeless
Everything I touch, I got the touch that got 'em wildin'

Timeless
Timeless
Timeless
I am just so timeless
It's a shame that you can't see me
#
I'm trying to make a pill, not trying to make a mil
Just trying to make a pill to make them feel the way I feel
But I'm opposed to medicine, so I just got to deal
With feeling how I do on the daily all by myself

It's the truth from the booth, still yelling it out the roof
My brothers, they put me on, told me do that shit you do
Went from laptop mics and the lofts saving eighths
To I know we got a half left, but let's go get some weed
It's that 517, baby, my big bros raised me
Since a early age, rather rap than play with the neighbors
Used to post up magazine clippings, inspiration, reaching
Trying to catch it, wrap it up and rock it like an infant
G shit, Be back in '03 changed me
Three letters "JNL" ingrained in me
Bitch I turn to number 9, when it's time to break the ice
We been building through the night, don't look, confused now that we're right
Use the pull the E-Brake, back into the driveway
Never liked their way, that's why we do it our way
SESH embossed in the earth that we walk
Even when we go it won't, future fossils stand strong

I'm trying to make a pill, not trying to make a mil
Just trying to make a pill to make them feel the way I feel
But I'm opposed to medicine, so I just got to deal
With feeling how I do on the daily by myself
#
People crying, people dying
I just hope we can, I just hope we can
Find a way, find a way
Find a way to do something, find a way to do something
When the walls cave in now, who do you turn to?
When everything's lost, who do you run to?
If you got someone you're a lucky one
Because I'm living in the world with nobody there, no
But you don't live with that, no
So don't give me that, no
I get high sometimes, I realize sometimes
Just like everybody

Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sleeping at the bottom of the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm sinking, sinking with the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
Like I'm singing, yeah singing in the ocean
Underwater I'm caught up in emotion
So now I'm sleeping, yeah sleeping with the ocean

I'm just sleeping in the ocean
And you didn't know
#
Ready come on, come on now

Raining on the cold windows
There's many ways the wind may blow
There's many things that I would like you to know
I'll forever do whatever that it takes to know

I will do whatever for you
I will sleep forever for you
I will do whatever for you
I will sleep forever for you

Raining on the cold windows
There's many ways the wind may blow
There's many things that I would like you to know
I'll forever do whatever that it takes to know

You know that I will
Tell you everything I feel
You know that I will
Tell you everything I feel
You know darling
You know darling
You know darling
You know darling

I see your face, I feel your pulse
I know I'm alive cause I can feel your hands in mine
#
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven

You don't know me, no you don't know me
So don't act like you do
'Cause you wasn't there when we were behind the neighbor's house
Just taking apart the shed again, taking apart the shed again, taking apart

You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven
You don't know where I'm from
Back in the 517, it's nothing like heaven

Congratulations, you have reached the last level of journey to Sesh Island
Choose your character
You have chosen... Bones

Is it possible to lose if you've never noticed?
Can you see tomorrow if today is bullshit?
Things get fucked up every now and again
Living in a snow globe's lame as shit
People cutting off each other's heads for their beliefs
People dying in the streets so we just sit in our seats
Give our 2 cents about it then go on with our day
A sympathetic post about it, now you feel a-okay
Don't nobody wanna cry till it's them that's gotta die
I don't understand why, in the end we all fly
In the end we all go and gotta let the pistol blow
The second you take another life, the second you turn into a hoe
You a bitch and you know it, pussy, cry me a river
You have feelings that you couldn't carry on any further
Motherfucker, that's life, welcome to the fucking world
Pick a number, get in line

You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, you ain't the only one going through it
You ain't the only one, everybody does it at different times

You have defeated the enemy, you have saved the day, thank you
Bones

Useless, useless
Useless, useless
Useless, useless

They say that they fuck with you then they turn around and say
"Go back to the older you" then I laugh and turn away
They say that they'll never change then they sell out for some change
Whips and the diamond chains see to me it's all the same

Useless, useless

(Take ’em up, take ’em out, bring ’em out dead)
(The Virus)

Paul Wall tippin' hit it then all walls flippin'
Better than all ya'll trippin' bitch what's up?
Deadboy walkin' see me now everybody watchin'
Did it now everybody talkin' just like us
Cashed, I'm a motherfucking mess
Atleast I say a slurred up speech then I rest in peace
They want my all but they'll never get the best of me
I keep the rest locked up then I ditch the key
See I could go a little harder bring the lava make it hotter
Gottem' ringing out their shirts like "fuck"
Carhartt patch 48 up in the back
Jump straight up out the cage in the trunk
I don't know the city boy I came up from the gritty
Tell his parents that we left his body somewhere where it's chilly
I don't hail from a place where you grow up to be great
I'm the creep from the motherfucking first ave lake

I never thought I'd live to see all these fucking dreams
RIP to the whole fucking scene
Let it bleed, let it bang
Bitch I do what I want when I please
Let it bleed, let it bang
Bitch I do what I want when I please
#
The boy in the bubble the furthest from trouble
When I look at you, it's like damn
You give me sympathy practically instantly
I feel so bad like how could I be mad
You on some shit I don’t want
You on some shit I done did
We all got idols but don’t feel too high up
And fall to an untimely end
Go ahead out with your friends
Ima stay in and make ends
Meet, like a blind date
Fuck what the time say
If it ain't five to sesh then I can't
You yet to see the best that I can
Earth will end if Bones get uncanned
Sherpa lined everything let them see every stain
Fifty-nine everyday burnt to the membrane
Flashback slumped in the breezeway
Thinkin' I can't do this shit forever
Fuck doing their way, imma go my way
Hundred highways not long enough for my race
Imma take it further than that
All these pussies think they take it further than rap, no
You take it nowhere quick, nobody give a fuck 'bout the money that you get and
If you convince yourself any different
It's safe to say you gone and been missing
Off in a land I could have predicted
Molded by thoughts of those who don’t get ya
The scum has arisen
And no bitch don't tempt me
Cause I have been patiently waiting for my time to lose it
Please come and offend me

Feeling something like Larry David
Observe the world and then I get to shamin'
Shit go wrong i'm the one they blamin'
While the rest get on stage and they blow it like Kramer
Stranger-stranger, who really stranger?
Cause I don't know you but I know my anger
Worried about your album say you need more bangers
Bones never approach that ledge with danger
Say you a star end the conversation
Me and my brothers make the constellation
Ima get it now I'm far from patient can't sit still I forever go crazy
The store clerk know what I need when I walk in
Who bought out the bricks first night that they got in
Who got what they need when they need it I'll drop hints
I'm pointing all over like I promise it's not him
#
Fuck out the way, yeah
All your shit lame, yeah
I feel no pain, we're not the same, we in this thing
Scrapyard boy, backyard noise
Mold in my veins, can't breathe
Fuck this world, wasn't meant for me
Or the other way around, either way
We got what they need to get this bitch movin'
You see and repeat but still you can't do it
That's just reality checkin' back
Go back online and go flex them racks
The people you swear that would have your back
But they the first one to go ghost when it black

I hope you get all this money
And realize that this shit is nothing but trouble
I hope that I figure out all this shit with time

Here we go again sitting in the alleyway bitch I'm on a roll again
Glass in the street bums sleeping on the curb
100 so-called good people pass without a word
And they say wanna change it
You don't wanna change 'less it's something that you pay with
Say there's a price but you yet to ever pay shit
People talk victim but don't ever wanna save shit

You, you got what it takes but you'll never do shit
You, you see and repeat and still you can't do it

Sesh

People wanna get close when the money come
And the beat goes on "parara-ram-pam-pam"
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
People always gather round where the fire starts
They don't ever wanna help till we in the dark
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo

I used to sleep on a pool table
Now I got tables that's out by the pool
Back then thought life was a cruel fable
Now I realized I just didn't read through

People wanna get close when the money come
And the beat goes on "parara-ram-pam-pam"
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo
People always gather round where the fire starts
They don't ever wanna help till we in the dark
Gimme a second, I need to catch the tempo, tempo
Gimme a second, I'm caught in the limbo

Step in the room they like oh no
We gotta go go we gotta ride look at the time oh
Now what do you know know
What are you waiting for, I know you see the door
I presume that you'll find your way out

I'm underneath the soil for you down, down, down
Even when the world is over I will be around
Too far ahead they say wait, wait, wait
Please let us play, play, play
I say no way, I say no way, I say no way

Step in the room they like oh no
We gotta go go we gotta ride look at the time oh
Now what do you know know
What are you waiting for, I know you see the door
I presume that you'll find your way out
#
Everyday
I get so cashed I don’t notice I’m breathing still, hey
I'm the white nightmare I’m the proof that dreams are real, wait
Saw me then there's no question they see me still, hey
Don’t act like a stranger my angle of dangers real
The king of the dead, the lord of the graves
The lower the sun, the colder the shade
It's hardest to tame the waves in my brain
The riot inside me is breaking the cage
Unleash your rage, still I’m standing unfazed
I promise you won’t bat a lash in my face
No matter how many shows ever sell out
I will ditch it mid set to show you what I mean

And you'll never get my confirmation
They get inspired then shun the inspiration
I'm feeling like I'm on another planet
I use to creep all night just like a bandit

Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go

Know I put on, put on, put on every time
Know I put on, put on, put on every night
Know I put on, put on, put on every time
Know I put on, put on, put on every night
Came along way, you do it the wrong way
We do it the right way, every night, hey
Came along way, you do it the wrong way
We do it the right way, every night, hey

[Instrumental Outro]

What do you mean, yeah
What do you mean, yeah
What do you mean, yeah, yeah
Rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'
Forever goin' goin' goin' goin'
I could never stop for nothin' oh no
Sittin' in the back i'm smokin' oh no
Same old shit its the same old Bones
Creepin' up behind with the same old flow

You know
I got this shit
I got this shit
You got nothing

Stage shakin', life changin'
I swear last year was at the coinstar clankin'
Droppin' pennies down stuck, now gotta shake it
Rewind 5 years was the young vagrant
See through ya mind walkin' my mind racin'
Turn around and see the world, say they'll never make it
Old teachers, old people said I couldn’t make it
A dollar droppin' outta school, but I stayed patient
Now my blunts worth a week of work, fuck your raises
White skin, blue sky, new conversation
In a land where the snow doesn’t touch the pavement
Roll a backwood full cause my veins empty
Not above any behaviour no don’t tempt me
Love when the light glistens when it hit my razor
They always jaded, always fakin'
Keep it up and watch your little crowd turn vacant
Never done evolving I'm forever in the makin'
My philosophy of goals reach out and take it
And I’ve yet to put my arm back to normal placement
Fuckin' up the world every time I show my face and
I contribute to the scene with every fuckin' cadence
I create a new lane every time it's needed
Undefeated, they all conceited
No matter how many faces they put on, I can see it
It really hurts you, I’ve really cursed you
Anytime we change the world you change your virtue
Forever nervous, never working
They like ya surface but hate ya purpose
Give it up, give it up
Bitch it's not worth it

Came through the door like NWO
Put it on pause when we walk in the room
I'm getting just what i wanted and more
I could show you but I promise you won't
Bet you got dreams but I bet that you don't
Follow the lead when you feel in your bones
Maybe this will work out but you never do it
So you never will know
#
Sitting in the motherfucking dark, just smoking
I don’t want to hear no talking, ey
I watch, even when they think I’m not
Wide awake, I hear you walking, ey
Sleepwalk if the dope don’t come
Never really gave a fuck if you don’t like
The way we do it from the movies to the music
I smile and I know that it's alright

Fuck is the word, touch me and burn
Don’t make me embarrass you
Was eager to learn, fuck waiting our turn
There is just no comparing us
Do it right every time
Without even fucking trying
It never gets fucking tiring
I change up the way they write

I’ve seen it once, I’ve seen it twice
I’ve seen it too many times
“We hope SESH blow up”
It do, now they look oh so surprised
“Now it's different”, quit the bitching
I don’t want your ass to listen
Pour a trendy four and drink it
'Till your heart no longer ticking

Tired of the motherfucking hold-up
I touch the world and it froze up
Promise I never care, promise I never will
Give a fuck 'bout if they know us
That never meant a thing
Fuck if you’re listening
We come and save the day
SESH and it never change

Need to go a little harder, boy, and I am your best reason
Bitch, I’m cremated, creeping, every season is SESH season
I’ve been in it for fourteen winters
You were beginning just last weekend
I don't force it still they weakened
Now our words are what they’re speaking

Shit a little different, I admit it
'Cause now I can buy some fucking dinner
Pussies bitching like its tradition
Bitch, I'd rather you don’t listen
I'll be honest that's a promise, I ain't no one to look up to
Rather you look down on me
Frown upon me and tell me that I’m not what you thought that I was

No, I don’t need no “Yo Bones you killing it”
Fuck up and listen that's not why I’m doing it
It's not a choice, I am the noise
Static bring havoc, I live in the void
We are just something you cannot explain
Radiate rays that you cannot ignore
I don’t go quiet, I’m slamming the door
El say to get it, I handle the chore

Never fit in I stuck out like a sore thumb
And I’m numb everywhere that we are
My blunt go out and the people they run
Cashed, and I’m apt to attack when it's done
Look in my eyes, I take you to the sun
Drop you off, burn you, then take you back home
You could be right, still, I'll never be wrong
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be

Bones, Bones
Bitch, hell nah
Bones, Bones
Bitch, hell nah
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be
You could be you, but you’ll never be, never be
#
Like this and it go like this
Let it go, let 'em know that it go like this
And it go like this, and it go like this
Let it go, let 'em know that I go like this

I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
To open my eyes and see the world
I’ve been waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
I have been too patient I'm about to tell you the truth again
I have never seen
Not another one
Not another one like you
I have never seen
Not another one
Not another one like you
I lie awake and I think to myself
Do I really want to breathe
Then I see you and it all comes clear
You are the reason that I am here
I am here
I am here
#
Don't you come up to me
You ain't no friend of me
You don't compare with me
Let alone stand with me
You can't compete with me
We do things differently
You, you wait to be helped and we
We get up and do fucking anything
We make it happen
You just sit back and keep with the relaxin
Say you a rapper whatever will help you sleep do what you have to
Boy I done did it
That ain't your brain thinkin
That shit is mine it's time after time
They hang on the line don't touch it it's live
Fuck this rap shit now it's over
Know we done it all before and know we drop like cliffs of Dover
Making sure the drought is over
Used to post up under boulders
Smoking shit to drought is over
Now I'm older little bolder
And my shoulder stay get colder
Load up knockoff cola on the days our lungs were frozen
Trashbag lift the hatch come lift the back a batch 120 total
Never changed cuz I never wanna
Never distribute cuz I would have done em
Hope you don't see me when it's all done and
I fade back to the grey above you
#
Okay, you can get it, not offended, not a problem
Cause every single one that came my way
You know I solved 'em
I keep my phone dead
Still, they hit me, still they calling'
I take just what I need
Dropping and mix it in the cauldron
Drop (Drop)
Let it drop on they ass
Every shadow of the past
Blow away with the ash
Never stop (stop)
You can never get a pass
Step away from the trash
If you come in, you gon' get that ass stomped (Stomped)
I reside under the bridge
Where the dead come to live
Two stroke coated ribs get whomped (whomped)
Dirty rag to the mouth
You ain’t know what we about
Where the tracks and the route get dumped
Remember the Trail behind Jonna’s?
We'd gather Corona’s
They empty of course
And we bag ‘em
And go just get us a quarter
Of something that we thought was dope

Fuck it though, fuck it though, roll it
When it get bad, you will know it
Wallow away in the same fucking place
Just a person that hated that town that he came
Fuck it though, fuck it though, roll it
When it get bad, you will know it
We paid a fee all we got was the faux
All we wanted was fire and a blunt just to roll

Am I lurking at your door?
You don’t really want to know
Shut your eyes let it go
Put your dreams in a boat
Let it float
You gonna know when I come in through the floor
When the waves crash down and you wake up to a noise
“What was that?” “What was that?” “What was that?”
“What was that?” “What was that?” “What was that?”
What

Droppin' out the land where the map is your hand
Point to the Palm area, and then they understand
Droppin' out the land where the map is your hand
Point to the Palm area, and then they understand
#
We get it you'll never get it remember
Who let you know
Remember who said it
See Sesh is embossed in it
We are embedded inside of the world that we made
If you're lucky you'll get in it
Fuck all that renting shit
We jump to owning
I see your team, I see no one important
Do certain things that you couldn't afford to
Know that I've worn the ground down to the molten
Give a fuck bout what you say too high to relate
Too cashed to debate 48 to his face
Jaw broke on the curb teeth gone with the birds
Just a young piece of shit living life in reverse
If you see me will you tell me how you feel
I know you got some little bitch let me hear
Always screaming that you just so real
You'll embarrass every peer but you just been here

Could get a million views still I never praise that
They only hit up you cause I never hit em' back
They get a couple views
Now they good for just like that
Confused at the moves everybody making it's a wrap
Please leave me out of it
Bitch I'm too out of it
Please leave me out of it
Bitch I'm too out of it
#
I ain't in the mood, I'll be in the tomb ayy
Packed to the roof, 'bout to boom and clear the room ayy
We choose the rules and the first one is true ayy
You got to go i'm getting tired like a loom now
Everybody coming out to the shows
The same ones who used to say fuck Bones
I think it's funny to see that's just how it goes
So fuck away with that "look how far you've come"
You do the most, I do whatever I want and more
Could understand how you mad at the boy
Fuck your flow and all your words, shit's a bore
The cemetery corpse, I done skipped the morgue

Packed to the back pushing to the front
Smoking behind the curtains till its time to get it done
Packed to the back pushing to the front
Swinging both arms till the pit open up
#
You know I've been hoping and I am dreaming
Throughout the day all through the night
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
If I should fall off the edge of the world
I'd crawl my way back to you
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
It's another emotion
The difference in knowing
If you're going I'm going too
If I should fall off the edge of the world
I'd crawl my way back to you

Hehehe, Misogi

I can make them all shiver
See, I could make them all cold
I could turn the heat on up and watch them thaw and be gone
But you know that I've yet to do it
When I do, you will know when I lose it

N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so
N-n-n-no, n-n-n-no
Bitch, I don't think so

You know I've been waiting
You know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here
Know I've been waiting
Know I've been waiting
Know I've been waiting right here
Death is my haven
I am the raven's nightmare
Heard what they saying
Something about it ain't right here

365 nights I'm here now
I feel a lot of things but I don't feel fear now
The oak crack and the entrance appear now
I'm taking you to where I know the world won't hear now
Never worry about the shit you say, they say
I do my thing and leave their heads spinnin' like beyblades
Waking up and roll repeat till the daybreak
I'd rather be inside the world don't feel the same way
No connection I can see you lagging
I'm fy_iceworld cooling relaxing
Lagging you freezing
Never gave a fuck before but now you reaching
Now the world keep calling me
Locked door, plotting more, planet don't bother me
Want to be like us but they don't wanna take the chances
There's nothing to this shit just shut your eyes and let 'em have it
Still the fucking best in town
I hit the dope then do the mess around
We smoke 14 then leave the rest around
Drugs in every room never ever running out
Chlorella tabs consume until I'm cashed
Don't take my words, the ingredients on the back
Died then I thrived like Galileo
Now they all believe what they use to hate so
I guess the jokes on you
I see right through
SESH

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Real tree when I'm creeping so you never see me
Since I can't stop making money, diamonds won't stop gleaming
Hundred blunts just because, bitch it tis' the season
If you want to talk a feature you need to book a meeting
Every time we drop some shit the internet get freezing
Bitch I'm skinny like I'm Kel but these blunts on Kenan
Anything we start they try and come and finish
They say it's theirs and they hate the team cause they ain't up in it
Once I start a fire I don't ever finish
Can't feel my legs, this dope got me kneeling like a Christian
Bitch we still will fuck shit up
Sliding around with the windows up

When I arrive to his section, his protection can't protect him now
He can say he sorry but apology won't help him out
You pull up to the venue, you see the helicopter buzz around
Police mad as fuck, cause we smoke who ever sittin' out
Your sis be at the show, with her motherfucking titties out
We hop out off the stage, see her begging us to touch her now
I can't trust a bitch, with that reason, they be running round
It's funny now, I could tell you stories about tour style
Lifestyle, lovely, Latina woman favor me
They wanna come and blaze with me, then fall asleep on top of me
I don't give no fuck bout no hater that's up under me
I'm smoking on my ounces until the weed no longer grow for me

Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Push around, push around
(ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

Now you dressing like a weathered peasant
Since the shit is trending heavy
Looking broke like Levees, but your tag on bag say Fendi
You disgust me not offend me
Pray you'll never feel me near
Hold my breathe, 10 Mississippi
I don't want to breathe the same air
We absorb through our pores so I condemn myself from them
Pin my hair back and then share all the tales I got to tale
From the then to the now
Moments live inside the ground
I can see and hear the sound
When I walk familiar grounds
Organic cotton line my pockets
Ain't no blood inside these fibers
Millions dying, sewing and tying
For all the stupid shit you buying
We ain't here long so it's easy to ignore
The happening's and just act as if this life is strictly yours

If I disappeared I know the world wouldn't notice
The moon would rise in the night
The sun would set in the morning
And I wonder, would they ever have guessed I was here?
If I disappeared I know the world wouldn't notice
The moon would rise in the night
The sun would set in the morning
And I wonder, would they ever have guessed I was here?

Even if there's not a problem I would probably overthink it
'Til there is, is, is
Alright when it gets night
But when it's bright I see this life for just what it is, is, is
Feeling like my body light enough to lift up, sighting's heighten
Then I turn back into mist
Tectonics under pressure, hands holding onto weapons
Yelling, "Do away with the men"

Skeletons dropping like Geronimo
See, we just animals
But dialect can't justify what is critical
It goes beyond words
I'm out and onwards
Above the young herds
Their screams I overheard

Even if there's not a problem I would probably overthink it
'Til there is, is, is
Alright when it gets night
But when it's bright I see this life for just what it is, is, is
Feeling like my body light enough to lift up, sighting's heighten
Then I turn back into mist
Tectonics under pressure, hands holding onto weapons
Yelling, "Do away with the men" (Yuh)

They be wondering where I be at (Yuh)
Boy, I'm somewhere that you'll never get (Yuh)
They be wondering where I be at (Yuh)
Boy, I'm somewhere that you'll never get

You are in the mix with DJ Stinkynuts
Welcome back ladies and gentleman
This is your boy DJ Stinkynuts
With the 1 &amp; 2
Today with have a smash hit from Drew the Architect, Smitty the BG and Bones
As My Uncle Rick says, “Let em Fuckin' Drag”

You've have always seemed to know
Just what I have been needing, oh
You've have always been the one
Even when there is no one
If I freeze and overload
I'm still encrypted with your code
You've have always seemed to know
Just what I have been needing, oh

You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know
You're all I want to know

"Down in yon forest, there stands a hall:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with purple and pall
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything
In that hall there stands a bed:
The bells of Paradise I heard them ring:
It’s covered all over with scarlet so red:
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything"
Frozen

Sitting in the motherfucking dirt just hurt
Always bitching about you never get the shit that you deserve
While you rotting on the curb, I'ma take off with the birds
Waiting for the right time but for me now works
We forever create levels, hit the lever, kill the power
Every dot a witching hour on the clock upon the mantel
Don't be acting like you mental you don't really wanna feel it
Hearing what ain't really there seeing what you know you isn't
Exhale blow the leaves, strip search all the trees
Bones like his forest sharp leave if you don't want to bleed
All they wanna be is me all I wanna do is leave
I contaminate the minds of the viewers of the slang
Fuck
And I thought it would be different
Still the same message, don't care if you listening
And you used to be doubtful
You play the game but SESH make the console
How many fucking times do I gotta go and say it?
You ain't fucking with us, touching anything we fucking made
They watch then repeat through their own shit (Own shit)
But they'll never duplicate the flow bitch (Flow bitch)
If it ain't SESH, then you know I don't know it (Know I don't know it)
If it ain't our show, there ain't no point in going

Oh
I am what they're not
They land in the rocks
I'm a motherfucking problem, oh
I aim for the brush but I landed on the top
This a good little spot I know
I am what they're not
They land in the rocks
I'm a motherfucking problem, oh
I aim for the brush but I landed on the top
This a good little spot I know, oh

I've been smoking, browsing, looking at commercial spaces
Bones been saving about to crack the bank and make the place
That we can make shit
I'm gonna make sure we straight with every check its half I'm stashing
Put that on myself we better than well off I promise you that shit
Use to camp for grams working hand to cans
Pushing pressing printing cashing for some rashions when we can
Fuck is good the answers us
Came from blunts of angel dust
Mudbog, hunt dogs on the trail
And you know that they looking for us, bitch hurry up
Canvas face, oil features, Prussian blue inside my liter
Liquid white when I slice get bleeding
Legends every step we leading
Give you eyes to help you read
Lend you mine to help you see
The scenic route, the truth
The hidden path you thought there would never be
Look for me you'll never see
Only chance is in your dreams
Think of me before you sleep
And hope that leeches through the sheets
Mirror mirror on the wall
One day you will show me me
Till then I will float around this house
And tell them all to leave

Leave, leave tell them all leave
Leave, leave tell them all leave
Leave, leave tell them all leave

Please don't make me ask you twice
Please I'm not going to ask you nice
Please don't make me ask you twice
Please I'm not going to ask you nice

Smokin' the finest
Stop and rewind this
I shop like the climate
Fuck what your time is
Drippin' in diamonds, we shinin'
Smokin' the finest
Stop and rewind this
I shop like the climate
Fuck what your time is
Drippin' in diamonds, we shinin'

I'm gettin' paid from the west to the east
I'm wild'n I really gotta sleep
Fuck ya dope, cause ya boy gotta eat
Every city, every night, with the team
Break it in just to throw it in the breeze
Cut stones on my knuckles and they clean
Break it in just to throw it in the breeze
Cut stones on my knuckles and they clean

From the jump
Only cracker that's crackin' this rap shit
From the jump
My face make them freeze, but that razor with me
Make 'em jump
Guttin', Unravelin', repeat until I am numb

Still no preservatives, stick to your murder shit
Capsules and milligrams you never heard of it
Stick to the surface shit, sleep through the dirty shit
I'm whipping clips while I'm wrappin' up furnishes
Cherry oak cabinets, this is class with no assets
We come around, you just circle our absence
Decorative accent, elegant lining, curb appeal with minimum signing
Bones got the flow like soap
Tryna grab a hold to clean for you though
Stood the world up and i played my role
Pale skin, bright chains like keys in the snow
You don't wanna know the kind of things
That go on inside of my dome
My body's a home and my skull is my room and I spend my time bored in the dark
Bones

All on borrowed time, to stay within the lines
Hold on, fuck up if you suffer, don’t bitch, complain or whine
Just take what the world has given you
And with you know every day's anew
You can reboot your systems here
Uploading modem’s all you’ll hear
#
French terry cloth hangin' off me swingin'
Gritty drugs, soft clothes, everything knitted
Rigid brass, patch the holes, now the bitch hidden
I'm way too far ahead, I'ma start again before they finish
I think I passed the limit for they so-called physics
Thinkin' I couldn't pass a point that I've been passed for a minute
I could show you the way, or I could throw you away
Teach ya life and pass away and forever sleep in the bass

Stepping up out my comfort zone
(I'm stepping out)
Just to show you that you can't go wrong
(I'm leaving now)
Tell me about it, things gotta be strong
(I'm stepping out)
Yell but nobody knew where you are
I'll spend eternity waiting for you, if you ain't ready to talk
I can wait it out
I'll spend eternity waiting for you, if you ain't ready to talk
I can wait it out

Aye, skin and bones, so I'm ribbed like Balmains
Showed the world how to die, then it all changed
Fluid flowin' through my veins so war came
When I reappear with the rage from the dark age
On the other hand, fuck it
I'd rather let it build so when I unleash they can't duck it
The Underworld's finest, the graveyard's beloved
Thrash my skull, just to see my chains jumpin'
Valentino glisten, make ya whole vision fuzzy
Corpse hand swingin', leave ya whole section bloody
Tell us one more time how you fuckin' all theses hoes
Cuttin' you in five years at the bar alone
Sad little man, so you blame it on us
No, you not a has been, you a never was
Turn around swift and I'm kickin' up the dust
Elegantly cashed, on my throne I rust
#
If you don't want a problem then bitch stop talking
Cuz I'll slide up like a LG Chocolate
Last thing you need is to hear me knocking
Rather just stalk then I'm outside watching
Please be safe when you walking home late
Dunno what mood ima hold that day
Dunno what things  my brain gonna say
Tell me do these things and I say okay
Boy It's just us
Fresher then blood
Veins over flowing with chemical crumbs
Young and we dumb shit we do it for fun
While I'm getting the feeling you do it for none
Love to get bucks, chasing the almighty dollar you run
Hurting, I see you, I really do feel for you
But you have just done what can't be undone
Boy when you gone

Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same shit
Oh, okay I be doing the same
#
We do not fuck with you
You walk in we walk out the room
The place where we do what we do
Penthouse we smoke out the room
If you in the way, better move
There's no point in trying to look
I do not mean to sound rude
Oh no wait, Maybe I do
Lookin the richest, I'm drivin'
You barely grip and you slidin'
Didn't you say you wanted to be poppin?
I don't even give a fuck if they like me now
Fuck what they saying I'm doing my thing right now

What was that you said?
I couldn't hear a thing I was just zoning off
Lay me to rest
Find me a place in the sun to smoke
What was that you said?
I couldn't hear a thing I was just zoning off
Lay me to rest
Find me a place in the sun to smoke

You Should Have Seen Your Face

Seninle takılmayacağız
Biz odadan çıkarken sen giriyorsun
Yaptığımız şeyi yaptığımız yer
Çatı katı odanın dışında dumanlandık
Eğer yolumuzdaysan, hareket etsen iyi edersin
Bakmaya çalışmanın bir anlamı yok
Kaba konuşmak istemiyorum
Oh hayır bekle, belki de istiyorum
En zenginlere bak, ben sürüyorum
Sen zar zor kavradın ve kaydın
Patlamak istediğini söylemedin mi?
Artık benden hoşlanıyorlarsa bile umurumda değil
Onların dedikleri umrumda değil şu anda işimi yapıyorum

Ne dedin sen?
Bir şey duyamıyorum sadece bölge seçiyordum
Dinlenmeme izin ver
Bana güneşte dumanlanmak için bir yer bul
Ne dedin sen?
Bir şey duyamıyorum sadece bölge seçiyordum

Tell me now what the fuck who, which?
Tell me now what the fuck who, which?
Tell me now what the fuck who, which?
Tell me now what the fuck who, which?

Smokin'
Just the right amount I swear to god I'm floatin'
Focused
Never off my shit never showin' signs of slowin'
Chosen
Never asked for shit but of course, now everyone know me
Glowin'
I'm draped in diamonds it won't help your ego to notice

Nobody do it like me that's a promise
The things that they saying I might be beyond it
Nobody do it like me that's a promise
The things that they saying I might be beyond it

Smokin' all the time, the money ain't there
People get gold, but the money ain't there
All of my time, I rather be here
People get money and get murdered in here.

One and only
Mack like Roni
Mannie fresh jigging into motherfuckin home base
Damier checks that's a motherfuckin cold case
Lookin all around and its nothing like the old place
Whoa
Black rob when I open up my eyes I'm the first one surprised
When I'm looking like whoa
Use to pay in quarters now we pull up the store
Baby run on through the door like go
Team never gave a fuck SESH forever going up
Every second of the day, every breath that's in my lungs
Every time I fumigate
Turn the breeze to a gust
Drop it down where you stay?

We could stop drop and roll forever
Cuz fires happen no matter the weather
You can hope for the best but you know the worst might come
Just leave my body somewhere dark
Put all my things in a box on the porch

Yeah, aye, aye
Fade into the scene
Know its bones
No "who's he?"
So they pull they cameras out and zoom like boosie
Fruits of my labor, all my fruits from the neighbors
I don't bend for no favors
Bitch I give em every flavor
Moves every day and that's how I've remained
Ever since Nigo had the ice cream chain
Back when a 100 dollars sounded like a dream
Now it's 100 times that every time I scream
The bandwidth way too ligh for me
I break the server
I fry the machine
See people never really took a liking to me
Up until now they turn from sour to sweet

We could stop drop and roll forever
Cuz fires happen no matter the weather
You can hope for the best but you know the worst might come
Just leave my body somewhere dark
Put all my things in a box on the porch

Broke and I smoke so, yeah
They got the money and they got the dope
Broke and I smoke so you know I need both
Do it no mask just to make sure you know
When you see Bones better board up the door
Not from the coast I came up from the road
Made up of dirty snow gravel and stone
Broke out the mold of inhaling the mold
It's bold how much hate that I got for the world

Fuck all of your negative energy
I don't want nothing to do with any of you
Let me talk my shit
Say you gon' do some shit won't you do
Say you know shit that you never would do
All I hear is this

I don't wanna hear no more
Talking all that shit before
I done heard it all a thousand times
I don't wanna hear your mouth
Talking all that shit before
I done heard it all a thousand times

"I do 50 push ups every night and it's not a sexual thing it's just push up's really"
"you are pulling at strings now"
"how many do you do a night"
"I do 50, I do a night"
"put that in the pipe and smoke it"
"I do not smoke"
"Shut up! your wife is harassing me now"
"C'mon man"

Keep my hands in my pockets
My words to myself and just keep this shit moving
The world can just do what they want
Shut they eyes say your prayer to the useless
Just like a human, get it then lose it
Converse about doin' but never go do it
I'm nothing special
More worthless than ever
100 woods now I'm deader
I could never be better.

Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way
Everything different
And I'm the one to blame
Soon everything distant
I don't want to feel this way

I shut out the world and I do what I do while I'm here
Nobody near the same when I look in the mirror
Seshin still
Espadrilles lifted with some drugs lit
Boomin like a drumkit
These other teams don't want shit

And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
And that's a promise
I know, I know

If these dreams don't work out that's a shame
I'll be waiting by the planter as it fills with rain
Forever I'm viewed in a different way
The boy with a ride that never came

If these dreams don't work out that's a shame

Forever I'm viewed in a different way

"Apparently when he was getting his hay…
And he was getting it, I suppose, where he shouldn’t be getting it maybe…
But uh… he heard a banshee…
And he dropped everything and ran home and he was as white as a sheet and he was frightened of the light and he got an awful fright, but like…
And somebody in the area… somebody be known to him had died…
Upon the night never has it so happened. Now, Believe it or not, it could be anything…"

What it is
What it is
I say the word and it's over
Fuck what they told ya
What it is

The best in the world
Don't care what you heard bitch
What it is

Fuck is the problem
Got em we solve em
I'm the resolver
Show up end all em
Mind fadin off so I gotta get rollin

Motions fluid like oceans
Got em' out wonderin' what's the commotion
Look all they see a corpse is smokin'
Til I turn BONES and show them who own it
How does he pick up the world and just mold it
Almost as of it ain't nothin' to hold it
Shit, now I want it
But she can't have it
Shit is too fragile
No one can hold it but me and I'm glad too
Sittin' in the backyard smokin' new dope
While you wonder why your work don't work
You can work til it hurt then they lower you in dirt
Then I kill your whole discog, just one verse
People hate fakes so the people hate you
The word got out now your friends hate too
Water level risin', only thing you can do
Let your lungs fill with the fluid, yes

What it is
What it is
I say the word and it's over
Fuck what they told ya
What it is
What it is
The best in the world
Don't care what you heard bitch

I wake up early in the mornin'
Put on my jewelry get right on it
I waste no time, I get to rollin'
All black, head down just like I'm mournin
Killed every city I perform in
I promise boy you can't afford me
Don't gotta price for these informants
I know my style ain't nothin' formal
I wake up early in the mornin'
Put on my jewelry get right on it
I waste no time, I get to rollin'

No, no, (c'mon) no
(C'mon) No, no
(C'mon man) No way

Vince up on my tags, stay relaxed in knitted rags
My house is covered in Neiman bags, find me posted in the gash
With the lights off
Use to smoke that shit that smoke smell just like lysol
I never liked y'all
So I stay in my house, plottin' up on my couch
Don't open up my mouth 'til I make sure the check don't bounce
See when we steppin' out, don't need no weapons out
I used to get left out, now I don't need no extra clout
You and yours so extra'd out, that's way too much you doin'
It's way too far, you reachin', better stretch before you pull it
Never see me out, dyin' on a private route
Used to hop the fences on the nights we used to hide it out
Now I just do me and they so quick to go and write it down
You can do the things I do but never be who I am now
In this bitch forever, 42 carats hit my sweater
I'm ready, we set the bar like it's heavy
Then go like Richard Petty

Every time I turn around, I see the same thing
I see the same faces, I see the same names
Every time I turn around, I see the same thing
I see the same faces, I see the same names

Eyelids permanently like I got the cold
Sprinkled in diamonds, filled with violence, shown around the globe
Rings lookin' like I'm climbin' out the fuckin' snow
Twinkle like powder, I could pawn off my weight in gold
And jewels, the rules, they might work for you
But not for me, I follow my lead, now it work for two
The waiter know my name, my skin can sense the fake
Don't come around with shit that'll dead you, please don't test your fate
Cause I am who you meet, when you no longer breathe
Your pain, it is my reach, now bleed and feed me, let me eat

Push me out to the blue, let me see what it do
If I sink then let it sink, die with the sky as my roof
Push me out to the blue, let me see what it do
If I sink then let it sink, die with the sky as my roof

We use to count
On the trashbag ounce
Sticks sticking out
Now we dont gotta do no pickin out
We just claw at the jar till we think we out
So tragic but that never happen
Dead end music you get no traffic
Only thing worse than to hear you rappin
Is to listen to the sound of a stale wood crackin
See the seshcrown and the peasants get dashin'
We make racket, they book it like Scholastic
Never met passion, you don't know action
Never heard of doin' shit just cause you have to
Never took steps, you know me, I'm glad to be
Never on stage, you forever in the rafters
I'ma show you ways you can do it, no askin'
Reachin' for favors that you never had to

I can show you things, there's a hundred million ways to be the one
But you gotta do it your own way
I can show you things, there's a hundred million ways to be the one
But you gotta do it your own way

Couldn't he do it how we do it?
That's something you'll never know
Couldn't he do it how we do it?
Go and sell out every show
Get shit thumpin', get 'em all jumpin'
Do whatever you got to do
Still they never do
What they do for us for you

You say you pour a four in a styrofoam
Leanin' now you feelin' right at home
One or two cups, now your eyes are gone
You say you hate the man but you helpin' him
You still a resident, just as irrelevant
Drinkin' up all of his medicine
Talkin' that bullshit like you really think it
Preach about poison then pour up and drink it
Fuck are you thinkin'?

The legend, the myth, hair to my ribs
Appear in the river when times are grim
If I got your clothes then you know what it is
Prove that I'm wrong and I'll grant you the gift
In the river, I'm keening
Up in the wastes, I'm floating away
Wailing and screaming, you know what it means
That's you or your family that's now on the way out
Say goodbye to the world
Close off your ties if you see me in the dirt
Every birth is a curse
Some choose to reverse, some let it unearth
The trees resemble these crooked hands
Walking alone in no man's land

Wandering, wandering, wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering

If you need it then you know I got the info
Take a right then it's down to the next road
Heirlooms glisten like the snow make my neck froze
Current strong and the wind, I'ma let it blow
If you need it then you know I got the info
Take a right then it's down to the next road
I'm the bean nighe showing in the white robe
Show you how to come back into life's room

Wandering, wandering, wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering

It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him

I came through to collect, I am collateral debt
My molecular structure only got two presets
I could rot to the core and leave a trail with my flesh
Or turn to the universe and turn your world to a mess
I shoulder all these burdens without breaking a sweat
And if they wanna come and test, I fight 'em off with my chest
Both hands up high, holding up all that's left
I'll let it drop the day I do and now the planet's at rest

It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him

Went from laminated tile to brown granite stone
Turn the carpet on the floor to a light grained oak
Back hurts 'cause I don't sit up right
Last night was up dopin' 'til the Sun was the light
Day before was floatin' on the water, eyes shut tight
Don't wake me 'less you got some pressed juice on ice
Don't hit me 'less the conversation ends with a price
Don't fuck with me and act like I've known you for life
'Cause that would be a lie, 'cause that would be a lie

It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him
It must be the rain, saviors haunt him
His pain, deep sleep to dream of puppies dying
Just like the stains on him

I am the sun, I am the breeze
I am the trees, I am their leaves
I can give you shade, or I can take it away
I am the rays, you can't run from me
While you've been trying to figure it out
I work the winds that clear the drought

Label this shit that won't let them judge
Smoke while I strut through the mud
Say what you want, still, I do what I does
Breath of fresh air I'm a gift to your lungs
Fuck what you say, it ain't true
Night to the day, we ain't you
No need to impress you, no need to out-dress you
Just need to outlive you, so I'm eating better
Died 100 times now I'm back once more
The graveyard shake and the moon get low
The time get slow, and the blunts never go
Out like you, when your 50 seconds over
I'm contract sober, you gotta lie smoking
Locked in a deal, now you on the shelf molding
Thought is a green bid, at least where it's poking
Now you down, bad knees locked by the police

Please step away this is just what I do now
Get the fuck 'round me, if I don't know you now
Please step away this is just what I do now
Still in the yard, but we lie with them tombs now

Powder

Sick animals deceased, riding interstates
Off the truck to the market, now your dinner plate
And you think you clean
None of my labels read BHT
Plant based proteins, slow me like morphine
Everything saturated, everything for me
For you if you want it to
I know it's hard 'cause the humans fucked up the loop
Sick people spend money, why the fuck you look astonished?
What the fuck's a business wanting other than profit, bitch? Nothing
Just breathe, don't think too deep
Where the undertow heavy and the current don't leave
Under trees where the shade bring safety
All my mother hoped was that I got home safely
BPA free bottles on the counter
Too cashed as of lately, I don't wanna think about, I

Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying

Stop with the speaking 'cause I done heard everything
Don't come too close to me, boy, I hurt anything
Don't wanna be here, but thank you for letting me
Look in the mirror and think "am I what's best for me?"
Raised in the place where it's best if you die
Nothing there's enough to keep you alive
Even if you do find work
You'll still be living in a town made of dirt
Fresh grain from the best plains
At the shows head-banging till it's neck pain
Next blunt, next night then the next day
I'm cashed till I exit, let me explain
No phone, no number, no conversation
Blood creeping through my veins with such contemplation
Do we wanna let him live? Hell no
They could struggle till they go, but they'll never be BONES

Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying
Know what you saying, I know what you saying, I know what you saying

Stand up straight just like a man
Be counted with all the rest
Work real hard and graduate
You need a well deserved good rest
Find a job and find a mate
Settle down in a house in the suburbs
These are dreams they gave to you
I can feel when they're not yours
My skin peels like wallpaper
In the house that we don't go to anymore

Feelings are far too radical
To ever see eye to eye
A mother's son was killed today
Only what she knows is why
Beheaded by hands of so-called faith
Maybe for a chance to live in the sky
Whatever the goal and point they saw it
I don't think that was the way to go about it
They don't see a way around it

Finally, I've come home, slipping off my shoes
Into a land that brings such safety to me

Stepping up my block, young Bones let me rot
Over thinking non-stop, till my mind in a box
Cash, and I'm shaking, so I cannot pick the lock
A.M to P.M, from tick to tock
While they worry about being top, I'm just happy that I got to be alive
While they strive just to be called the best, feel lucky that I ever got breath
I can walk, I can talk
I can move like a human
Filaments running through my limbs, like the stems of a tulip
Last thing I want is money, first thing I want is sunlight
Photosynthesis, collecting rays until the sun dies

Take in the rays, and give me some rain
It's all I can do, it's all that I need, it's all I can take
Take in the rays, and give me some rain
It's all I can do, it's all that I need, it's all I can take
Is it all I can take? Is it all I can take?
Is it all I can take? Is it all I can take?

Countries invented ingredients based off the cancer that's linked to the study
Our Country do nothing, they don't want us healthy, it don't want nothing else but money
No concern of dying, no concern of living, the outcome is so fucking funny
Humans are fighting with weapons, but more of them die from whats inside their stomach
Nothing but trash, and you thinking it's natural, hope that they never look into it
Killing myself every time that I smoke, but I draw the line for when I'm eating bitch
Fuck what you thinking and fuck what you heard
Fuck all these things that they're feeding me
Fuck all the time that I wasted away, eating up what has been eating me
Say that you care, bitch I know that you don't, eat up the burger wash it down with coke
American living you're doing your best, you working real hard and the weekend you rest
Biotech boys, overflowing with disease, all I see when I see your team, fuck away from me
Biotech  boys, overflowing with disease, all I see when I see your team, fuck away from me

And every time it breaks down
I hope you feel it too
With every time that I scream
Comes an expression of me for you
I am not leaving this place, I am locked inside
Fuck out my personal space, I am not alright

Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down! (Break it down)
Break it down, let me see you break it down!

Even the way you touch my skin, it lets me know
All I wanna do is watch you live, that's all I know
Even the way you touch my skin, it lets me know
All I wanna do is watch you live, that's all I know

Came in the door, still fiendin for the dope
Bones searchin' high and low
Used to get cashed off resin bowls
Used to risk our flesh and bone just to take some money home
Used to think that havin' that would make us happy, we were wrong
Had a lookout when we shook down, boy don't look at me, just look down
When we see a fucker put down, tell me though please now, what is good now
Crackin' the leaves when I walk at night, made a lotta fuckin sight
Talkin' to me left, don't do it, make sure that you talkin' right

Say you got plans, real big ones
The fuck you talkin' bout?
It's all I ever heard, shit never happens
What you barkin' bout?
Say you got plans, real big ones
The fuck you talkin' bout?
It's all I ever heard, shit never happens
What you barkin' bout?

Better come up with that money if they wanna talk to me
Better come up with that money, bitch, cause I don't talk for free
Better come up with that money if they wanna talk to me
Better come up with that money, bitch, cause I don't talk for free

Healthy Boyz, bitch, we at the top of the food chain
Talk shit, bitch, get whooped like Liu Kang
Robbed like 2 Chainz, snatched for 2 days
Eddy Baker buzzin' like two ways
Blessed like a sneeze
Drugs in my jeans, scumbags and rockstars on my team
Big long ass blunts called on my key
College girls dreams, steeze so clean
I'm a man around my way, you can ask around
I stay with the loud like Pastor Brown
Me nino brown, I'm a bastard child
Born in the nile, raised up so vile
Hope you fuck the top down at the bottom
Flexin' hard with a couple models
Backwoods and high life bottles
Livin life drivin' full throttle

They give you modest goals and honest roles to play
They told me no and I turned and ran away
Calling me was a whole new life something I've never felt
Beckoning like screaming words not spoken they were yelled

In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today
In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today
In the end if I'm the one to blame
I will take my life and cut my ties today

Walking with Bones, so you already know
Take 'em back home, to the roads that I know
Sleep where you sleep, and you die where you born
Fuck what you know, and fuck what you've been told

Shaved hair running through the snow, boy with the frostbit skull
Now back to tell 'em once more, the young white mac came back with the flow
Never had money or hometown pride
Every night ride, like tonight we die
Town fucked up, so the kids fucked up
Everything cash, from the views to the drugs
Looking at the world only way they know how
Throw away your time til they throw you in the ground
I don't like you I don't like your friends
I hope you never like me, let's not pretend

Looking at the ones at the so called top
Looking at us for the so called props
Try to take sound, but you can't take style
Can't replicate nothing that we done, get around
Move up out the way, kill yourself today
I hope you know the money that you makin' ain't a thing bitch

What, what, what?

They switch sides, switch lives, switch mindsets
With every season comes change, plus dying trends
That's why I stay within a sector with no line ends
While it seems like the rest is struggling to fit in
I'm outside in the night, blowing out my smoke
I try to wipe my slate clean, but too much was wrote
Say that you killing it good for you
Say you put on for you and your crew

Well
See I don't know them, and I don't know you
But still you know me, does that speak to you?
Does that leech to you? Does it seep through you?
Cause that sure is sweet that you break the rules
Break the truth of these bitches, pay you for all of these digits
Do it cause love, don't do it for bucks, the money ain't leaving here with you
The memory of you is real, when you go on the feelings they feel
The stories they tell, the times that they share, with you will asure that you won't disappear
Kale and chlorella my meal, smoke like Cruella De Vil
Ghost like I'm not in the mirror, follow me close then you gon' disappear
What?

I was gone for a minute, now I'm back
Young Bones cashed, ripping Chia seed packs
Counter top's sticky from the fruit getting pressed
Local grown goods make a multicolored mess
Corpse full of flax, and a skull full of ash
Touch and feel the past, let the flashbacks flash
Young William Lamb trying to live off up off the land
Living off the plants like it's 1810
Sticking to the plans, cause we know the fucking end
We've all seen what happens, still, they try and just pretend
I don't wanna know you or your friends, cause you do it for the wrong reasons
Young and I'm hopeless, bust all my emotions
The place I was put is a rock that's eroded
Trying to work the motion, blocking out the bullshit
But all I can do is pick grains for my potions
Let it sink in, let me be the fucking lotion
Cleanse you of disease, and I leave blunt smoking

Himalayan salt from the docks
Grind it down then I pour it on top
Himalayan salt from the docks
Grind it down then I pour it on top

If I had to sum you up in a couple of words, I would not be able to
Where the feelings stem, is far beyond dialect, it's somewhat beautiful
Far too many thoughts clashing, till there is not one, every time I act surprised
With my eyes is not the only way I'm seeing you, cut the mountain I would still have you in my view

You are etched into my skull till the vultures come
And gather up my bones, and fly south for the winter
You are etched into my soul till the vultures come
And gather up my bones, and fly south for the winter

Bones

Say, you walk up in the club, throw a couple bands up
Now you think that bitches gon' like you (Like you)
Say, you hoppin' out the Coupe with antennas up on the roof
Like them bitches gon' slide right through (Right through)
We don't give a fuck about how much you putting up
Oh no, we don't care enough about your shit to look it up
Not impressed by your ego or the human you've become
Just a slave to the trends, another grave for the young
We know you got the money and we know you got the clothes
But what the fuck that mean if the shit don't go?
We know you got the bone and we know your name known
But what the fuck that mean if the shit don't go? (What?)
SESH is the reason they fucked every season
No stop for a breather until we stop breathing
We got what they need and we drop when they fiendin'
We get like they suffer, we kill it then we leave it
Nobody comparable, bitch, it's hysterical
I don't show up in the mirror, it's a miracle
Rap is the area, fuck what they carrying
Up on the back of the whips so I carry it
I'd be embarrassed if I were you
Take a step back and just look what you do
I'd be embarrassed if I were you
Take a step back and just look what we do

No matter where I go
It'll be with you and I
All I want is death
If you're not in my life
Everyday the world is changing inside and out now
Every second I feel it coming, don't let me let go now

Baby don't go away
Baby don't go away
Baby don't go away

Don't say you don't know what I mean
Pressure lingers in the room, I can feel it up in my knees
I feel it when I awake and ignore it until I leave
It's the little things that count and it's the little things I need
If you find the bottled message that I wrote, I hope you read
It's been floating for some time, was assuming you'd never see
Out at sea, it gets lonely in a way that's so unique
'Cause you still feel the presence of the waves and the sea
See, I patched up the grate, but I can still see a leak
Goodbye to the world that brought me to my knees

Say that you hate it, continue to do it
I do not know what you are doing
Say it make money so ain't a thing wrong, except now ya' whole life fucking ruined
Put in the system, where papers the mission
I don't want it, yet, I still get it
Fuck everything at this point I'm just over the planet I'm currently living
I'm all in
Unfortunately
I'm all in
Unfortunately

All I wanna do is hold you near and keep you safe
Ross colder than the wind coming in off of the lakes
Nowadays I don't even have the time to hate
I look at all of them as weeds and weeds rot away
I often stay inside and hide away
Fuck the time a' day
I'm watching all my enemies straight decay
If you looking for a final fade, pick the day
That is if you ain't broke enough to get down with my rates

Walking through the village, hood up with no recognition
Compass pointed to the wind
Smoking, walking, never winning
Long sleeves so my rings don't shine in the sun
Young scholar, what’s a dollar, no I never needed one
Acting like funds fell down in my palms
Like it ain't just us, like I'm not just Bones
Tryna hit my phone, all you get is tones
Socializing is what I don't, I'm a never let it go
1930's trunk, leave the cotton sleeve tight
My floor got grain and the sun runs the lights
Vanderbilt vision, only bitten with precision
Fountains in the kitchen spitting while the chef still flipping
Still, death twisted, now I'm still life-giving
But I be life takin' if my happiness go missing
Growing up I never listened now they wish I would've changed
Cause every word spoken falls upon of arrangement
Opinions turn to files
I never ever save them
Views turn to photographs
I never ever frame them

Upon the dying grass, under the overpass
Where I'd catch my breath
I don't need the road, I've tuned it out, I'm on a different station
Thoughts of you is what helps me now when I'm feeling complications

I love the thought that we were all just infants
New to life and so helpless in an instant
I love the thought that we were all just infants
New to life and so helpless in an instant

He was a man who found salvation living amongst the sea
Fell aboard and washed ashore because the tide took me
Little sticks in shapes of letters, in hopes that they will see
Once they see the lightning, they're the ones that sail away

Fuck a hoe and a cop and a nigga what he not

I can split a million dollars, get it back 100 ways
Boys we slide cross the stage, no smile on my face
Till I'm fried, and I'm straight, till my bank overlays
Ridin' 'round the city I ain't got no roof
Wanna taste the water, I'm living proof
Open up the shades, just to see the view
Money in my face, I can't look at you
If you want a feature, I'mma look at you
Like give me all your money, give me all your loot
I'm posted smoking weed, cutting up the fruit
I'm looking in the mirror, they can't fuck with you

They just some, old men, takin' young ideas
Fuck up outta here, spread the word and disappear
Skinny white trash, cut you like a John Deere
Bitch we movin' into gear, making moves all year
Working for the label, try to dress like you ain't major
But you listening and watching, while you creepin' like the neighbors
If you see me steer clear, words you don't wanna hear
Hands, you don't want to feel, all I wanna see is tears
Fuck this competition, I don't need nobody listening to me
I never gave a fuck about a cosign or a million
We doing shit the way we want and nobody can take it from us
You can try to be us and that's cool, just make sure that you humble
Did a few tours, did some shows, now ooh shit, picture of the team now it's just the music blueprint
Teach you how to do shit, ridin' with the crew shit, fuck whoever say they doin' it cause bitch we do it
#
"I Know"

Take it from me, today will be your last
This town will be your biggest downfall yet
Say your goodbyes, these words will be your last
This life has been your biggest downfall yet
#
Now let's begin
Close your eyes
And take a long, slow, easy breath
In through your nose
Hold it briefly
Then let it go
Allowing your thoughts come to rest
There is nothing you need to do right now
This is your time to quiet your mind

Baby, you don't know where I've been and I'm feeling it
Baby, you know more than me, and I'm [?] it

Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way
Show me another way

[?] living through
Happens [?] living through
[?] every [?]

"I would have to be the incredible Hulk. I'd love to be the incredible Hulk 'cause nobody could- nobody could win against me. I'd smash them all and I think it'd be a lot of fun."

Somehow it's just not hard to me
I see you struggling and it's hard to see
Think you're a big man, with some big plans
Think there's power in your stance, and it's odd to me
If you want something go get it, don't wait around to see the winter
Spring doesn't fall in the summer
Life doesn't stop, so make use of the minutes
Make use of the minutes, we get them and we're wasting the seconds
Only regret I regret is regretting the things I've regretted

Think about it, think about it
Get back to me
Think about it, think about it
Get back to me

Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round

I pull off like I'm Takumi
Except I'm in this S13
All I'm gonna do is keep on riding, while they follow me
Hear me in the trees, from the mountains, when the tires screech
Catch me in the streets, with my squad while we smoke the scene
I don't give no fuck about who mad, I look up for me
Why go switch positions, when you got a hometown team
All she wanna do is smoke some weed, while she stare at me
I pulled off on her, because I knew that's not the best for me
She pulled up on me in her Sileighty tryna reach for me
She can't even race, cause she can't focus when she think of me
When I look ahead, I see all that I'm gon' need to see
I can not recline, until the humans learn to spread some peace
See me smoking weed, while I think about some certain things
Imma' ride forever, I don't need to stop for anything

Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
Where the hundreds go down, where the bottles all round
#
Standing staring at the wall in my tomb
Thinking maybe I could show the world soon
Light's shooting through the cracks in the roof
Fingers tracing all the etches in my ruins
Ear to the ground so I know when they comin'
Know it's us pulling up when you see them boys runnin'
It's a bittersweet sprint cause I can tell that they love it
Cause they've never known another like us, let's be honest
I don't say that I'm the best, I just tell 'em that I'm SESH
Break my neck, fuck a check, bitch I do it like I'm hexed
Since the womb, been consumed by  the planet I was grew
Bad seed, bad roots, bad sun, bad youth

I don't fuck with the world
Give a fuck 'bout the world
#
Been a freak since Creep
Still a man from down the street
That they do not wanna meet, show my teeth and leave you weak
I don't need no breeze, I don't need no sun
I don't need no money, I don't need no one
Bitch, my time has just been begun
None that I've done can get redone
Talking them guns like they for fun
Where I'm from, they lose the young
Hunting rifles in the kitchen, foam cooler in the truck
They get fucked up and bang like they time is almost up
Drink, click-clack, then they drop you down
Think it's cute, think they making new sounds
Got paid and they think they're cool now
But that's obligatory, nothing new now

Used to this shit
Thinking you hard, I've got news for you bitch
You're new to this shit
Reaching for me and you're losing a limb
Bitch, I'm used to this shit

Rewind, eject, send it back
On a hill with a Map in my lap
Trace roads with my finger, where they at
Walk the world like I woke up just like that
From this far down, they look just like ants
So far from my home, I stand
Insignificance, in-admission when I see the roads at first glance
#
Like this?
Yes. x2

"This is not a wig, it's fucking real
If it was a wig it would fucking come off right about now
I dyed it black, you like my shirt?
It says Mt Vernon, cus that's where I actually live
HOMETOWN"

How in the fuck are you 'bout to say
The way that we do it is not the way?
No, don't you sweat it, you not in the way
Nothing you do can put an end to my day
Cashed as fuck, in my bed I lay
Look at the ceiling and fade away
Stressin' and checkin' on me for a blessin'
But I can't hear nothing, I'm gone for the day
Sure you can afford that? I get it
Lookin' like a bum, only think I'm holdin' pennies
Pull out your mortgage, just spend it in a minute
Take it how you want it, get mad when you get it
Blame everyone around you for the money you ain't gettin'
Boy, man up to the life you ain't livin'
Times, they get chiller, sometimes I forgive him
My mind's on a rhythm, so don't fuck up when I see you
Loose neck, cotton chains bangin' off my body soundin' like a dog walkin'
Razor barkin' if you by me, let the scotch light blind 'em, let the switch restyle 'em
I ain't never goin' back to what I did back in Howell
Old BONES, new flow, still flickin' ash up on my clothes
1-800-DEADBOY if they need to hit my phone
Estate sell ogles, on the finger make me hopeful
We ain't never goin' back to nickel dimin' for some produce
#
Boy I'm walking through the hall like Dylan McKay
Brandon Walsh hair back, like we back in the day
I don't never talk to strangers 'less I'm bout to get paid
Steve Sanders lookin' boy, get the fuck out my way
Trying to use is what you do, and don't say no thing
Cause we heard about you and we don't like what they say
Don't let a couple co-sign's fuck up your brain
Start actin' like something, give a fuck where you stay
Say you know about us, but you don't know no thing
Encapsulate me, go ahead, lock me in that frame
All I do is get confused by the fact kids still
Lookin' to the pussies that don't say what's real

I guess that's just how it is, I know that's just how it goes
Dirty nails, wrinkled clothes, Bones never with some clones
That's just how it is, I know that's just how it goes
Dirty nails, wrinkled clothes, Bones never with some clones

I twist up a wood and then pick up my target
Flick off the ash and then pour up the water
#
Somewhere between the graveyard and the forest, I'm somewhere just smoking
The temperature drop but for me It's still hot, cause I'm from where its snowing
Weatherman reporting "woods get stale, so remember to close 'em"
Don't fuck with my motion, catch me a case and then close it like Conan
6 in the mornin', Don't do no yawnin', creep while you sleep, thought you said that you want it
Feast when I eat, while you pourin' up porridge, rather be me then be what you supposed to
That mean you'll never be nothin' but fake, so watch how i do it and say that you hate
Then copy and paste and say we can relate, to not be original that ain't a lane
But somehow they livin' like that every day, way to content with just lookin' the same
Same fuckin' views, same fucking brain
Fuck is a label somebody please tell me, if there's a contract, they know not to involve me
I roll all the nickels, I make all my money, so how the fuck you supposed to tempt me with hundreds
What is a thousand, what is a million, to someone that knows the price has risen
SESH is who with me, moving too quickly, no future prices, this shit changing weekly
Death is so easy, life is so random, now he just do it, and money they hand him
Some get a check and go live in the Hamptons, me I buy fruit, dope, and diamonds in cash

What
Wait
Wait
SESH

The mainstream out of kings so they look to us
Papers in their face, I tell em' we ain't in no rush
Yet to try, so I mean it bitch, you ain't seen much
I ain't where they sell shit, I'm where they cook it up, damn
Ridin' in the eight-passenger van, whole team un-employed, but get paid in advanced
You bend your back working hard for a gram, bitch I make three O's before I break this O in half
Bet I come through with my team and make it smoke like it don't work
Bitch you see me, want to follow like I'll lead you to the work
But I'll leave you in the earth, 517 'till it hurt
Don't go nowhere unfamiliar unless you like the feel of dirt

Wanna buy what we made but we ain't sellin'
I can see it in yo face, you ain't no felon
Wanna buy what we made but we ain't sellin'
I can see it in yo face, you ain't no felon


We got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my-
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now
Chains bangin' around my neck, cus we got money now

Pulled up blowin' dope under the freeway
Team wild, they don't know how to behave
Say the word and we at where he stay
Play predator fake and be the prey
Phone buzzin, re-up, been three days
Free shippin' on my dope like eBay
Too many blunts, sesh looking like a replay
The reason that these pussy boys glitch, freeze frame
I don't expect respect, so when you see SESH, just protect 'ya neck
I really mean it, protect 'ya neck
Both hands on your throat, like you're begging for breath
Like you're begging for Brett
Brett Favre, Mr. uh, Favre I presume
#
I've been working on myself, I just hope it's not too late
I just hope that you can see a difference in me
If you're running short of air, if you need, I will be there
I will breathe into you
I've been working on myself, I just hope it's not too late
I just hope that you can see a difference in me
If you're running short of air, if you need, I will be there
I will breathe into you

There's been an awful lot
With regard to that chemistry
Which was unique and never to be replicated

SESH

Smoking like a motherfucker, higher than a motherfucker
Bitch, please stop the playing
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, death to them other boys
We can't hear a word you saying
We don't know your name, can't hang with the gang
Crowd jumping when the bass get banging
All I need is dope, so I gotta get paid
Never see me on the stage unless the money is arranged
My hair 1080, my teeth 240, my blunts 4K
And my dope you couldn't load it
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
If they ain't calling with a price, we don't answer that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that
We gon' handle that bitch, we gon' handle that
Trying to fuck around, bitch, we gon' handle that

Bitch, I'm smoking sacrificial, back to back
Blink, you might miss it
Boy, my team made up of legends
And my ring made out of crystal
They ask me how I been living since these labels out to get me
But the only reason they want to meet me is just to say they fucking met me

I got money on the table but—
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet
Money on the table but—
I ain't count it yet
I ain't count it yet
I ain't, I ain't count it yet

Bones...

Blowin' this dope, what should we do?
Riding around, smoking my doob
They wanna do this shit just how we do
That's something they'll never do
Blowin' this dope, what should we do?
Riding around, smoking my doob
They wanna do this shit just how we do
That's something they'll never do

Blowin' this dope, goddamn I just bought another O
Why you worryin' 'bout your bullshit? No one to know
Who got the lighter, I'll roll me another
Who got the lighter, I'll roll me another
Who got the lighter, I'll roll me another
And then another one
We ain't gotta worry 'bout a stunt
We know our shit speaks for itself
See, we ain't got to worry 'bout us
We know this shit pay for itself
We ain't gotta worry 'bout a stunt
We know that shit speak for itself
We ain't gotta worry 'bout us
We know that shit pay for itself
See a man like me don't need no reason
I'll come and get ya
I'll come and get ya
I'll come and get ya
See a boy like me don't need no reason
I'll come get ya
Come and get ya

Blowin' this dope, what should we do?

I was born in a place where they killed themselves before they raised
Their own children, their own little them
All of the flaws, wrapped into one
You made me, are you proud of what you made?

All I need
All I need
It's sad 'cause you can't
Call for me no more (I just can't)
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
Let it all just go
#
Nobody can hold up a candle to me
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
Nobody can hold up a candle to we
SESH be the team and we can't never leave

Now we walking through the jewelry store cashing shit
When we ride around and then we don't bag this shit
Money come and go so I don't look at tags for shit
Give me that give me that don't ask for shit
8 Pairs on my fingers with the sapphire decks
Hundred thousand dollars if you need my best
One million dollars if you need that sesh
Used to pour whatever just to get that fix
Ashing shining smoking in my diamonds
Outfits blind you the woods rewind you
Weapons eject but I don't do the pressing
Hundred million deadboys creeping for the pressure
Shows like a lecture they sitting no question
So you say you ride bitch boy you just flexing
Boy, I know you see us and I know you just stressing
Tell yourself your good but deep down I know you isn't

Nobody can hold up a candle to me
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
Nobody can hold up a candle to we
SESH be the team and we can't never leave
#
Bitch you know I got the juice
Smokin' doubles, cuttin' fruit
Ring twinkle like the stars
So when we pull up in the car
We light up like some 3M
They want the team, we them
Spirulina by the ounce
You don't know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
Solar panels round the house
#
Everyday they're getting older, more worried 'bout looking younger
It's a patternized cycle, show your face with every slumber
It’s equivalent to being full and longing for the hunger
Guess it only takes 9 months to build a life of suffering
Money's not enough for them, just waking up's enough for me
Told 'em how I felt and then we sat uncomfortably
It's up to me, one of them said
If you think you can't well it's all in your head
As I shut the front door behind me
For the first time, I’ve come out of hiding
And the light's so bright
For a second I'm blind
I can't see the city, I can't see the cars
For a second I'm fine
#
I was in the tomb, until I moved where it's sunny
Now If you listen closely, you can hear my diamonds hummin'
I'm used to pocket change, so it's funny gettin' money
Either I'm filling up my lungs, or I'm filling up my tummy
The Legends of the Hidden Temple, 24 carrot emblems
Chain look like Olmec, rings lookin' like the Incas
Mayans on my diamonds, they admire when we arriving
Whole team fucking cashed, see the sesh up on my eyelids
Gemstones float, while the ash flow down
Know we make our own juice, like we make our own sounds
No free verse, cause I don't do charity
Pistol in my face, crack a smile, there ain't no scaring me
Everybody wanna sound so damn unique
But if I heard your song, I ain't thinkin' 'bout the who's he
Bitch I'm thinking turn it down, know you thinking fuck this boy
Go ahead and speak a word, I promise I will love you boy
Bitch, I'm thinking turn it down, know you thinking fuck this boy
Go ahead and speak a word, I promise I will love you boy

"What do you want to do?
You and your bullshit. You've got a bullshit answer for everybody
But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer
Because you don't know"

Blow these O's in the air
O's by the pair, we ain't never gotta share
His and hers blunt's while the whole world stares
Pullin' and pinnin' back my hair
Grab another leaf and fucking tear
In the lair of the rare
Feel the glare when you approach
You don't see me, you don't hear me, you just feel me like a ghost that I am
Bring a scam, I'm a bring the whole team
All I ever am is me, all I wanna do is break your dreams

Look who done came up (what), raspberry blunts with the granny smith cups
Look who done came up (what), almond milk with the Flaxseed on top
#
First I climb up out the sewer, then I roll in like Killua
While you work on being cooler, me and my boys pullin' maneuvers
Say your crew is full of shooters, you and your friends are fuckin' losers
Wanna be just like them rappers, bust some guns and pour them deuces
You home drinking chemicals, I'm smoking, pressing  juices
A young Max Gerson, all I'm taking in is nutrients
If I hear some words that I don't like, I'll find out who he is
Put the pieces all together, now we go and do this shit

I ain't kickin' through the front, I ain't runnin' through the back
You don't gotta worry where I am, cause bones' know where you at
I ain't kickin' through the front, I ain't runnin' through the back
You don't gotta worry where I am, cause bones' know where you at

I know where you at, I know where you be
I know where you at, I know where you sleep
I know where you at, I know where you be
I know where you sleep
#
When the birds fly south and the snow come down and the crops all die
Bitch I'm outside, rolling these bones now Bones be high
If I ever go broke like I was last year, I'm not even gon' lie
Bitch I might ride, bitch I might steal, bitch you might die
Browning logo, moving slow mo
Cohoctah Woods but I'm still in NoHo
Eyes like GoPros, I catch the low low
I see what you don't, I know what you don't
Ghillie suits now, lined with goose down
Skeptic critics say that I'm the proof now
Hope they hate me, I really mean that
Change the game, bitch, who brought the scene back?
Let the fans down, I picked the fans up
Looking bend down, we got our bands up
Everything is just like I'm dreaming
If you ain't, you bitch, you ain't leaving
You ain't breathing, we ain't teasing
Always dropping, never take a breather
Showing up is just conceding
They wanna be us, they wanna be us but they can't
Could ride in Beamers but we ride in vans
Wanna see us, they surround the van
But the window tint make sure they can't
I'm just tryna get home safe
Roll me up a big ol' 8
I'm just tryna get home safe
Roll me up a big ol' 8
Feeling something like Joni Mitchell
I've seen some shit and speak on the issue
You live in hand but you talking pistol
Tell me how the fuck that work when they come with missiles?
They banging now, you laying down
Spraying rounds so you praying now
Don't be barking if you ain't gon' bite
'Cause we all know people that will tonight
#
Young boy used to drown in that alcohol
And if you dialing, 517 before you fucking call
I'm bout to hold K2 to my fuckin jaws
When waking up and gettin cash was a fuckin chore
Aluminum pay so we packin up the fuckin car
Cold nights, Tanqueray up in the fuckin jar
Ride, slide, feel the ice up on the fuckin road
White jeep, white trash, white fuckin snow
I remember everything like last year was yesterday
Used to set up rupture funds and make that money anyway
Then we knew how they won't ever find out how we did these things, that's just how it went down

Tables by the stack, thumb tacs by the pack
Gasoline with the rag, it went way beyond the matte
Tables by the stack, thumb tacs by the pack
Gasoline with the rag, it went way beyond the matte
#
Organic shampoo's with the lavender scrub
Out the shower hair drippin' while I'm raveling blunts
Granola with the almonds, hundred candles make it calmer
Sunny days, blinds closed, Bones never was a charmer
(SESH)
You talk about them commas, all I see is whips and bottles
We maintain our drugs in water, smoke and call it aquaponics
A self-sustaining home with tempered glass, when it gets hotter
Seven filters on the septic, clean water for the garden
My compost fills, stretching looking at the hills
Coring apples, cuttin' carrots, washing berries, rippin' peels

I stretch, I breathe, real deep
I eat, I sleep, I stretch
I breathe, I eat, I sleep
I SESH, I stretch
I SESH, I stretch
I breathe
#
Sleep like a freak and I eat like a animal
Step up to the team, that's something you ain't ready for
Wake up in a dying world, looking like the antidote
Heard you talking down, let me see where the anna go

Yeah, it's just like that
Thinking they creative 'cause they ass can rap
Chris said get back
Pussy boy take a lap, you don't really want that
As I post up at the house
Looking out the window, blowing smoke, laying down
I cut back to the scene from the past
Used to sound like Stone Cold when we used to break glass
Never saw the teacher so I never missed math
Never went to school so I never ditched class

Sleep like a freak and I eat like a animal
Step up to the team, that's something you ain't ready for
Wake up in a dying world, looking like the antidote
Heard you talking down, let me see where the anna go
#
All I need is wood so I can turn it to some smoke, bitch
All I need's a half so I can turn it to a O, bitch
Never had a friend so I'm used to being alone
Find me somewhere in between Howard Hughes and Nina Simone
What, Lilac wine with the fresh french roll
Subtitles off cause one day we might move
1887 when the Model T move
Through the cobblestone streets where I let my mind brew
Remember when we used to bring coins to the teller
Remember when we used to steal bottles from the cellar
I’m blitzing with some brother had the ice white camo with the twin 38's because we didn’t know better

I know what you're thinking, I'm thinking it too, shit
Smoke with my brothers, we ride on that crew shit
We pull up the people like who this?
Who this, who that, who that now, when I pull up in it they don't know how to act now
Who this, who that, who that now, when I pull up in it they don't know how to act now
I'm going hard, I'm going hard

This a brand new DJ Hip-Hop supreme smash
DJ Truck Nuts
#
You used to say, when I was down
There's more to life outside this, white trash midwestern town
You birthed the spark in my brain
Said it'd be sunny, but that night it rained
Wet shoes as I stepped on the plane
Found my seat and closed the window shade
I fell asleep and then awoke to a shake
I overheard like they spoke my name
The captain said, "It'll be a task to make it
To LAX with a storm like this
We'll try our best," he said with a nervous grin
You could hear the breath, you could see the face
Of a man who'd cut the tension if his hands didn't shake
He's got a wife, two girls, and a home on the ground
And the most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down
The most disturbing part is they don't know it's going down

I'll paint the sky you're flying
Tired of the Earth of lying
Lowering my eyes to see you
Telling all the lies to be with you

But not in the fire and not in the crash
The weather, the storm, you say will land intact
It's when he goes home that it becomes real
There's a small part of him that resents the wheels
He hates the wings and the bolts that hold them
Together like promises they never told him
He thinks they deserve the same life that he had
He wished the fucking engine would've blown to pieces
#
Heard a couple songs, now they thinking that they know me
I ain't taking calls to the world, I'm always roaming
Never need the time, so I never had a Rollie
Do it just us, so we never hear you owe me
Making sure we straight we put the money where we need to
Couple commas later, It ain't even been a week to
Blow the world a kiss and tell it I'll be back
Never I got, weather to be weathered
There's some hands up to be severed
But there's a seed I gotta plant
There's a line to be drawn
In the dirt, in the earth 150 feet down
I don't believe in the shit but it's heaven and it's hell
Could have took a "L" with the label
Instead, I make bands with El, what?

You are now tuned in to SeshRadio

Hey there to all you seshers out there, this is TeamSESH Radio Chip Kipperly coming back at you with a brand new week of SeshRadio
We have hot new songs, we have various singer interviews, we have sports, weather, entertainment coming at you, stay tuned for SeshRadio

Hey there all you boys and girls, we have a brand new one out for you right now, it's called ShaveMyHeadChangeMyName, brand new from SESH creator himself, Bones


Shave my head, change my name, and run away
Anything that will take the attention away from me, now what's that say?
I don't give a fuck 'bout the fame, that's the last thing I wanted to gain
Been a minute since we spoke, still I'm turning to a ghost, I can feel it everyday
See the ash flow down like snow
In the ditch, by the old backroad
I never had money to throw
Never see me in the club with hoes
See, the outside world is a backdrop that you'll never see Bones in front of
Rot, let me rot, let me rot away
Cut the blinds, kill the lights, let me fade away
As I lie up on my back and turn the comforter 'til I say
Things will never be the same
Really?


Hello and welcome back to SeshRadio, this is Chip Kipperly, I would just like to remind everyone that the third annual Uncle Ricky Blunt Run For The Cure 5K coming up this weekend, do not miss it. We still have tickets available, people. You have to call up and get 'em. I'm gonna be giving some tickets away in a little bit, alright? We have games for the kids, we have shows going on, live performances, you're not gonna see this anywhere else. Come, show your support, we're gonna give a little bit of the profit away to help the Backwoods staff out because, you know, we're just gonna be rolling Backwoods all day, alright? So it's, it's just gonna be a good day, come. 35 dollars at the door, you get all day, just come show your support for Sesh

Now, for everybody's favorite Sesh forecaster, Rob Schneider's kin brother, Lyle Schneider

Hey, what's up, guys? Lyle Schneider here for you today, going over the weather and uh, we're gonna see what the forecast is on these next two days

This is the weather channel, weather you could always turn to. For accurate weather forecast at your convenience, 24 hours a day

Just wanna update all you guys on the weather for the next couple of days. It's looking very lovely going into the weekend, sunny, 70's, mid 80's sun days. Uh, night times are going to be tipping down into the 40's so make sure you have your coats. Uh, light rain expected Monday through Wednesday with a clearing-up around Thursday and nice and sunny during the weekend. You're listening to SeshRadio


Why don't you just give me the bag?
Give you the bag?
Sir, would you mind telling me what's going on here?
Chrissy, I'll handle this
Fellas, you seem to want this bag pretty bad

Pink lemonade shoes, roll raspberry blunts
While you out here getting stressed bet I'm home getting bucks
Side up when we buck, SESH never gave a fuck
Holding out both hands but you'll never get a buck
When your album gon' flop they gon' say it's dumb luck
Ain't nobody wanna own up to the fact that shit suck
Begone lil men, begone lil boys
Ain't no place for wannabes, this the level with the noise
Sidewalk talk, it's the avenue thought
No crease in my jeans, no wallet, no watch
Place in the trees, breeze blowing to the east
Inhale what I got then I disappear with ease
My legs get weak when the Backwoods cheap
Two hearts in my eyes, smile cheek to fucking cheek

Fruits on the trees, bag of Flax Seed
Juice on the ground, spitting pits in the weeds
Fruits on the trees, bag of Flax Seed
Juice on the ground, spitting pits in the weeds


Well guys, it was a very sad day in Sports today. I don't... I'm not gonna throw names or anything like that, but we had some... we had some people, you know, cheating, tarnishing the good name that is baseball and, umm, we're just not gonna stand for that. So... I hope these people... I really, I want more names to be brought, brought out into the light because I will not stand, I will not rest until this is done with, alright?

Hey there, this is Chip Kipperly, we're gonna check in with our brand new intern, Lyle the intern, at the Uncle Ricky Fun Run Sesh For The Cure. Lyle, what's up?

Hey there Chip, Lyle here coming at you from the ground of the Uncle Ricky Fun Run For The Cure. I got little kids playing around high as shit, we got blunts rolling up everywhere, we have bouncy castles, we have... like you said, we have wine and beer for the adults, everything is going on right now, come on down, 35 dollars still at the door. If you mention my name, it's gonna be 5 dollars off. Come on down and just have a great day

Shave my head, change my name, and run away
Anything that will take the attention away from me now what's that say
I don't give a fuck 'bout the fame
That's the last thing I wanted to gain
Been a minute since we spoke, still i'm turning to a ghost
I can feel it everyday

See the ash flow down like snow
In the ditch by the old backroad
I never had money to throw
Never see me in the club with hoes
See the outside world is a backdrop
That you'll never see Bones in front of
Rot, let me rot, let me rot away
Cut the blinds, kill the lights, let me fade away
As I lie up on my back atop the comforter I say
Things will never be the same
Really?

Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit
Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit

Makin' this money quick, and I don't even want it
Runnin' a mile with your style but it's stolen
Too many offers, inbox still loadin'
They acting touchy, but they know I never want 'em
They see the team, they see the shows, and now they want it
I never sell them what I know you can't stomach
So get the fuck up out the way, cause we the only ones that does it
Bitch I'm fresh off tour, while your ticket sales strugglin'

Back again with somethin' new to hate
Back with another style to take
These labels runnin' outta ideas quick
So they studying my moves, but they won't find shit

Running to fuck 'em up, while you lingering on the cusp of quittin'
You say you finished cause they just won't listen
Take five steps back, sit down just watch
I'm the physical result of doing what they said not

Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me
Keep your eyes on me, keep your eyes on me

Fresh off the porch, undefeated, it's me
Leave you torn and distressed like Hollister jeans
Fuck you and who supports you, they lying through their teeth
I'ma take 'em to the woods, I'ma show 'em how to eat
I bathe in the smoke, I lay in the leaves
The only reason that these pussies wanna say they don't breathe
Everybody wanna be dead, but they don't wanna die
Everybody wanna be us, but I do the same, I ain't gonna lie
I packed the backpack, got up on the last flight
Red eye, black blunts, landed in my next life
Detroit, straight to L-A-X
Still got pebbles in my shoes from the place I left
Everybody that I knew is either dead or almost
How I see it is, I was owed the coast
I've been cold too long, I've been nice too little
Such a combination making one bad thing for children
SESH

I make 'em freeze like Cabela's when I come around
I don't know how you could be jealous
I make 'em freeze like Cabela's when I come around
I don't know how you could be jealous

Never go slow, smart, slide when the flow start
You don't wanna see these eyes in the dark
You don't wanna feel these hands in the night
Veins breaking out my skin, like
Like knives in the fight, like kids in the street
Like tears down my face when I don't got shit to eat
When I'm sitting in my bed when I don't wanna leave
When I really need some water but I don't got a key
I don't… I don't really have a… I'm at my pad

I make 'em freeze like Cabela's when I come around
I don't know how you could be jealous
I make 'em freeze like Cabela's when I come around
I don't know how you could be jealous

Bones

I let my hair hang down like fuck it
I don’t wanna see no busters
Say the word round town is you buzzin
Well that's a lie because we know you nothing
We going live from the pit I'm above you
He stand in the pit he runnin
If you ever see me at a function
Know a lots changed I ain’t there for no huggin

I think your better
Think your better
Think you're better off
If you paid me no mind
And let me set it off
Now I'm drowning in the pond where
I say my final words

Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go
Where did he go
Where did he go
Tell me don't phase me
Now where did he go
Where did he go

Tell me don't phase me

Plugged like a motherfucking USB
Drivers updating while I'm counting up the USD
Delete the world, now these drugs just for you and me
Backspacing pussies, run upon me, boy, you will see
Escape keys can't help when you sleep (ah, ah)
Watch as you toss and turn in your sheets
Fingers on your lips, we don't need you to speak
Rip your drive out ya spine then the mission's complete
IP's getting traced then your veins getting laced
With the finest visual tracking that this planet's got today
Turn you into a iso, ring like a light show
Battery almost dead, smoke these drugs, help my life go

Doin' the shit that I do (Do)
Ridin' around with the crew (Crew)
Bring up your name, be like "Who?" (Who?)
We don't know shit that you do (Do)
Never had nothin' to prove (Prove)
Why you all caught in the loop? (Loop)
I'm smokin' with nothing to lose
Bitch, I'm the truth, all this is, is the proof

Makin' this money, countin' this paper
Lookin' so lovely, the fuck is a major?
Makin' this money, countin' this paper
Nobody touch me
I don't need nothing
Dope got me lazy
Woods got me lazy
I'm high for days

Doin' the shit that I do

Hold still it will all be over soon
Let me know if I can get you anything from the other room
Hold still, it's almost time for you
To come back to real life
I start to realize when I look in your eyes
The seconds turn to years when I'm touching your spine
And since we never age I forget about time
All my minutes spent letting you know you’ve got all mine
My nails peel back and my eyelids rip
Everything up in my nightmares shroud me with mist
Tied up to the bow, going down with the ship
Spark a blunt with my toes just to get a last hit
#
I want you to be happy and you're not
Not here with me
Not home with your mother
Not alone, not anywhere
You're what I was most of my life, Sam
I see it in your eyes, in your sleep
In your answer to everything!
You're barely alive!
#
Saying that you hard but no, I disagree
Thinking we cool but bitch I don't agree
I don't need friends no more
I don't want people
Since this is my dream
I don't even need sleep
Don't know ya shit never heard of ya tape
Don't know ya bitch but I bet she heard me
Worry bout nothing you worry about everything
You can do nothing bitch I can do anything
Voice of a Veteran
Veins of adrenaline
Once he step up to me there is no saving him
I will not pray for him
I will not savour him
I will make sure it's my yard that he laying in
Flame on my davidson
Ash on my razor
There's nobody like me for sure no caucasians
The world in my hands
Let it drop to the pavement
I never need payback
I only get payments

Thought I was done
But no bitch I don't stop
Act like you don't care but we know you lie
If you were to give him the offers I got
Put that check in his face and I bet he gone pop
Go to the club just in hopes that they spot
You get a picture now you think you hot
Walk in your town and I post on your block
Like fuck what you had and fuck what you got
People impressed with you but I am not
I'm strict with this shit
And you missing the plot
River the shit bitch my last name is Phoenix
I lie in the gutter and stay undefeated
I'm smoking a lot more than you and I promise
You probably be concerned if you were watching so
Just, just don't watch me then, it's fine, you don't have to watch, I'm not asking you to
#
I don't gotta pop a seal to sleep walk
I let my dope speak for me bitch I don't even talk
Every time you speak we know it's cheap talk
If you see us keep it quiet if we in public
Fuck a closed casket, bitch, put me with the trees
Let me rot, throw some seeds, water me and give me leaves
All I've ever wanted was to be
Breathing the way the ocean be
Haired tied back so I know what I'm doin'
Boys try to emulate just end up looking stupid
Thirty Blunts in the Buick had officer for the truance
No you would hate if you knew us
But you say we young and we stupid
But you the only one that stupid
If we talking 'bout the movement
You got shit that need some moving
Gotta job to pay, your cool with but your the last thing coolin'
While you sweatin' bout some bills prolly smoking you choosin'

Push away
Push away
Push away now
I can't take it another day
Let it fade out
Push away
Push away
Push away now
I don't ever wanna think about it

Push away

Push away now
I can't take it another day
Let it fade out

Bitch, when I call, pick the phone up
Hit the blunt fast then I slow up
Everybody out here got motives
When it come to you they got no love
Bitch I'm used to the sight of teens who quit life
Breathe in squeeze tight I'm gone for the night
Leavin' for the evenin'
Fall with each season
Crawl with each second
My heart is barely beating
Posted in the parking lot smokin'
If it ain't a backwood bust it open
I've been out here all day just hoping
That a bitch like you want a problem (Let's get it)
When I sleep I make money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill
When I sleep I make money that's real
You awake and can't even get a bill, bitch
Damn, that's terrible, I'm sorry


When I sleep I make money that's real

Ridin' in the car with it
Lyin' under stars with it
Stop then I part with it
I ain't gonna start with it
Lightin' up cigars with it
Smoking and livin' large with it
Do it 'fore you're gone bitch
Dead in designer clothes bitch

Ash on the floor, I'm cashed, so you know
Don't expect me to move, no, don't expect me to choose
Dopin' on the road, I'm coping with the thoughts
You know that all my blinds closed, you know I never leave home
Did you ever think that (maybe)
I would ever make that (crazy)
No one ever knew me (honest)
Now they all on me (stop it)
Sittin on my profits, applause is a promise
Young scumbag never thought about college
No, I'm not clean bitch
No I'm not nice
Just 'cuz you making music too don't mean we alright

Ridin' in the car with it
Lyin' under stars with it
Stop then I part with it
I ain't gonna start with it

Used to bump ProjectBitch
In the curves and the cul de sac, rolling up sticks, bitch
Bag full of cans, that's change in my hands
Coat smelling like mold, got snow on my vans, yeah
No bling, no peace, no rings
No mink on my shoulder, no brands on my feet
Now my phone won't stay quiet
Trying to sell me all my dreams, but I still won't buy it
I wish I was like you, fuck
But I can't 'cause I think too much

Used to bump ProjectBitch
In the curves and the cul de sac, rolling up sticks

What
Everybody hate me now just wait 'til I drop this
They want to put me on the shelf but I never ever sell
So you could never cop this
Right when they think I'm going left
I go up so rest assured you'll never top this
Spend a year or at least is it yet to release it
I'll teach you how to drop shit
Where all the hype that you had last year?
Nowhere to be found now it's just so clear
Nobody give a fuck about you and your shit
So go give it up
The nights get cold in Burbank
We light up thirty blunts let it warm the earth's face
Crossed out even the earth's plates
I'm walking at my own pace, still get first place
Spend it all cause I know I'll get it back
Spend it all just to get me on the track
Kinda funny when you think about that
People pay me just to kill 'em on wax

As I watched him drown
I remember the sound of bubbles being broken
As I feel the ground start to separate
And I'm fallin' into the open
I'm at the edge of the world
I'm 'bout to walk right off it
Now I'm talkin' to myself again
I just wanna stop it

Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on
Rollin' and rollin' and rollin' on

What?
Lightin' up the blunt while I'm thinking of you
Walking down the block, I ain’t whippin' the coup
Take another drag while I look at the moon
Young GPS, I come equipped with the route
I don't have to wonder cause I see the truth
I don't need love you can hear the proof
Break another bag while I feel the ruins
Start to look my way but I ain't in the mood
My closet's nothing but Harley
I ride hard without fallin'
Goodwrench on this deadboy
I rev the wheels now they foggy
Sponsors floodin' my inbox but there's one thing that they don't know
I stuff thick money in my thin socks
And not yet to sign for no dough

You don't wanna die with a guy like me
I know that you
Got another plan
No, you got another dream so why can't you?
Breath in
Exhale

SESH
Fuck you and your team
Fuck you and your dreams
You look like the rest and you sounding like me
Gotta co-sign now you think you a beast
Fuck that and fuck this
I put that up on me
Act like you hard but in person you sweet
Yet to meet you but I heard from the streets
You couldn't breathe if you stepped up to me
Look at my eyes and I'll show you the creep
Blade on my dick ain't a fuckin' thing changed
These baby boys rappin'
I feel like Ving Rhames
Bitch keep it down you got nothing to say
Watch how you walk
And don't walk in my way
#
What?
Light creeping through my window
As I rise I roll a blunt
Eyes closed when I smoke
I'll wake up when I'm done
Concrete meet the water
Where I take in the sun
Linkin Park when I spark
Every wood got me Numb
Candles lit, fan spinnin'
Feet up on the leather
Sesh burned in the game
Like the seal of a letter
No checks just cash keep it clean
Briefcase with the code you would need
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed

Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed
Blunt guts drip drip
When I bleed

People always talk about my come up
'Cause I've been going hard every summer
Pussy wanna talk about numbers
But you manage to buy them, that's why your shows so bummy
Ain't nobody out now that can touch us
Cut you boys down if you run up
Acting like you hard with your gun up
But if it ever drop then your ass get to running and running
I'm too cashed when you see me
Already seen with no TV
Already paid with no CD
Why you try to sell MP3's?
Just bought some dope cause I know that we low
My money is up, so the drugs never slow
Smoke 'til I go then I'm off to the store
Brick of the woods with some water to pour
When we ride, ride slow up in them lanes, bitch
Bones take your favorite rapper out the game, bitch
White trash, I could never ever change, bitch
Still the skinny white pimp with the black blade, bitch

Creeping up from behind
Money up on my mind
Butterfly on my side
Make it fly then you die
I've got lies in my eyes
All my times' been reprised
Compromised with my lies
Now I'm stuck inside my mind
Resurrect everytime I die
Crash and survive everytime I ride
Cash sight eyes with a blunt I fly
On my broomstick, high up in the sky
Levitate down 'til my feet feel ground
I don't give a fuck how you feel now
Never gave a fuck how we felt then
But now we on and now you want it now
Rolling with the roof blown off
Stolen when the blade get drawn
Hold it, do you really wanna live?
Do you really wanna die?
Do you really wanna try me?
Show me, tell me, throw me, roll me
Body made of drugs, might as well just smoke me
Hold me closely, put me away
Acting like a killer but you just so safe

That's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is
That's just how it is, I said that's just how it is

If I see you in the flesh, I hope you know
Your friends aren't around, gotta hold your own
Lay you down, turn you to stone
Lying in the gutter, this is your new home

If you knew me, you would hate me
When you meet me, you gon' say "I thought that he'd be cooler"
Everybody trapping now, everybody rapping
Say you doing it but I do it
Riding in the pickup doping
When they get close, don't hold me
Hair pinned up, I'm smoking
No scope but you know I'm loaded, oooh
See that boy get closer, yah
See that boy get roasted
Should've never tried to play me
Just a young scumbag from the dirt roads
No, nothing can change me (No, nothing can change me)

Four bars, Mac fully charged
Young DSL, it's the Wi-Fi lord
Network browsing, PayPal piling
Bones get violent and leave when it’s silent
3D textures, HD flexing
My keyboard shine like the modem when it's blinking
I'm only thinking that we should get away
URL blunts to my IRL face
Upload, download, baby if you down for
Me, like the Dow Jones, hold me like a dial tone
Upload, download, baby if you down for

It's un… It's unbelievable
The story… Of my life

Self-hate in my veins while she twisting up my braids
I don't gotta say a thing 'cause she know where I remain
I got memories for days, full of faces with no names
Image stained in my brain of me smoking in the rain
On the porch, fuck a Porsche, we ain't never leaving town
Fuck a job, fuck a gown, we ain't never leaving Howell
But a lot of things changed since CCD
I used to sleep in the house off D-19
Now it's funny 'cause kids want to be like me
'Cause I know they wouldn't like me if they really knew me

I'm making money, but what's it mean?
I think it's funny, 'cause all I think
Is how great life seemed when we were broke
No money, no food, no weed to smoke
But the money here now and we got the dope
And we always eat but I feel alone

And the strange thing is
There's not a sad face to be found
Everyone is just so glad to see you
And send you off right

Back when we used to recycle our bottles and cans, just to get money for dope
Back when we hopped in the van, take what you can, now we buying the O
People that make it look strange, peep through my blinds 'cause I know that they know
Bitch, I've been up for some days, thinking of ways to get out of this hole
Hold up, bitch! Hold up, bitch!
I don't want a problem but if trouble's what you want then hold up, bitch
Came from the place where the basement was home
Now the traces are gone
Never be back, no, I never feel bad
But fuck it, I guess here we just tryna move on
Floating down the river with a wood lit
Camo so I'm blending with the wood, bitch
Everybody say they from the hood, eh
You ain't never been to the hood, bitch

You know all of my niggas buck as fuck
They don't give a fuck about fucking shit up
And I don't give a fuck about showing niggas love
When I mean mug, I hit a fool then I shoulder shrug
I don't give a fuck if a bitch wanna fuck
All these hoes sluts so I don't let them touch
Nigga, shut the fuck up, fool, you ain't even tough
Trynna play me, I beat him down 'til I pick him up
Bitch nigga know who the damn Führer
You see my whole fleet, lil' bruh, count 'em up
Hundred million men finna fuck his life up
All I do is watch while the squad cut him up
Fuck a nigga mean, I woke up as a torturer

All my money go to dope
Even if money coming slow, I still find a way to smoke
But money always coming in
Never signed on the line but I'm paid like I did
The young white devil, all our shows look like they metal
Bones rolling up them petals then I'm back to my vessel
Haven't showered in a week, nothing special bout me
I'm just harder than whoever wanna act like the king

Wait until your back's got 'fore you start to act up
Say you rap but now you just wrapped up

Realtree Camo with the Carhartt blade

I'ma make you dark like it's late in the day
No matter what I think, you gonna hate what I say
Earnhardt blunts, smoking like we in a race
Friends turn cold like the blood in my veins
Thoughts in my mind, like the dirt in my graves
So I press my head to the wall, till it breaks

Take you back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold

Get out the cold, get out the cold
Life's too tough, bitch, please let me know
I take your life and turn it to gold
Roll my dope and turn to a ghost
Who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!
Said who you really think going harder than me?
Bitch, I'm dead bitch, bitch, I'm dead
Bitch I don't even breathe!

(SESH)
Feelin' something, like Rick Moranis
Blew up the kid, now he doin' damage
Oughta know, like my name’s Alanis
Hate on me, take a seat, young Christopher Hansen
I don't sweat all day, just to lie in a mansion
Break blunts, like glass, when you get the banshee
R2, R2, L1, R2, up, down, left, right
Then I get to bangin'

Take you back home, where the moon don't glow
Where the sun don't shine, where the kids don't grow
Uptown where the youth get drowned
In the rag full of ether cause the kids don't know
Suicide rate up high when the winter rolls in and the money still low
And when he feels that snow, he knows it's the only way to get out the cold

Memories of you, they start to fade
Only see your shade when I'm in the rain
I want to be your voice, baby, once again
Want to see your face before the end
Always in the back of my mind
If you were here I'd still be alive
When will you realize
Just another teen suicide
Close my eyes, I'm going cold
Die young, never growing old
I'm losing my fucking hope
All these blunts and they're getting rolled

I'm waiting by the water
I'm floating on my back
I'm hoping that you're ok
All I need to know is that
You're ok when I'm miles away from you
All I dream about is seeing the face of you
The rain hits the window and it falls like night
Lying in my sheets with you, with me

Hey, I know we're all, like, iPod friendly and stuff
But do you guys have a plug for my Zune?
#
Walking through the catacombs, bitches try to tag along
.Exe up on your man if he act Microsoft
Macintosh, having thoughts
101 blunts and a glass of Voss
Want to chill, ask your boss
Hope that job is paying off
Cash, cash, cash, all I fucking see is cash
Get cash, cash, cash, dollar signs when I ash
Spacebar, racecar, flip it like a face card
Like me 'til they see me, now they wanna play the race card
White in the night, drinking fire, smoking ice
Just a skinny white pimp named Bones, with the knife
No chain, no games, never catch me in the Range
If I catch you within range feel the reach of my blade

Feel it in your veins, feel it in your blood
Take you out the frame, put you in the mud
I'm the one to blame, 'cause you're the one that does
Put it on me, I don't mind feeling fucked up
#
Hood up, blade out, bitch, I'm ready
Pro club, type neck, bitch, I'm heavy
Dirty old shoes, but I get clean money
When you get money you don't care about nothing
Still I know that I don't mean nothing
It just feel nice putting food in my stomach
One million blunts, and I'm back to the curb
Young white trash, came back for the serve
Long hair, looking like a young white bitch
But you never see a bitch go like this
Roll my sticks, I'mma show my wrist
And roll of the diamonds, let it shine, let it glisten
White boys can't listen
Get too mad they don't sound like this
Watch out who you dissing
I don't say a word you just wind up missing

And it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
And it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
Said it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back
Said it's just like that
When I speak, bitch, don't talk back

Looking life Wolfwood
Feeling like Vash
Three moons in the sky
Two blunts in my hand
Blade on my waist if you tryna take a stance
Zero patience, quit the playing
Come and do just what you said
I got money in the mattress, bones in the casket
No, I don't know you but I know you ain't rapping
The teenage corpse, never catch me in a Porsche
Rather creep through these alleys till I'm back up in the dirt

Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids
Riding, sliding, dollar sign eyelids

Bitch, I'm getting paid now
Money in my PayPal
Known as the mantle, what them haters got to say now?
Getting cash, life is great
Eating shrimp fried rice with steak
Fucking hella hoes, I don't ever take 'em out on dates
Me and Bones rolling up that dank, getting hella bank
Smoking out the zip, all day, put away your 8
Black shades cover up my face, I can't see the hate
Take a Backwood to the dome then I meditate
We ain't never gave a shit, we just out here stacking chips
D boy fire plus I'm higher than a mountain is
Dirty money all up in my hands and I'm counting it
Headed to the top, will I make it? You can count on it, bitch
#
The kisses of the sun - Were sweet I didn't blink
I let it in my eyes - Like an exotic drink
The radio playing songs - That I have never heard
I don't know what to say - Oh not another word

I don't wanna hear your voice (voice)
Motherfuck you and your boys (boys)
Bitch, you can never make noise (noise)
Sit the fuck down, get low (low)
Sitting in the back of the pick-up (pick-up)
Got a razor with the hinge and it lifts up (lifts up)
Tucked in my shirt like a stick-up
Promise you ain't leavin' if we don't get shit uhhhh, so up
You don't wanna die, get down
Adrenaline runnin' to the sky right now
You don't wanna die, get down
Adrenaline runnin' to the sky right now

I'm always down to die, put my blade on it (blade on it)
Drive my body to the plot with my grave on it (grave on it)
Granite headstone, bitch, with my name on it (name on it)
Birthday dash, no date bitch, now what's that say on it?

I don't wanna stay, I can never leave
I'll never disappear, Bones always remain
I don't wanna stay, I can never leave
I'll never disappear, Bones always remain
#
Steppin' in the function, everybody know it's BONES
I'm smokin' in my dungeon, I just want to be alone
I look like Cheddar Bob but I ain't grippin' on the Glock
I ain't hustlin' on the block cause they pay me just to talk
Just to be me, easy enough for me
See all I fucking do is smoke and live comfortably
New dope everyday, new Woods from the corner
It's the Blunt Gut Guy, eatin' healthy, sippin' water
Mr Never Take a Shower, still cleaner than these cowards
I don't need a gold chain for you to know that I'm grindin'
Hated school so I never went, hate the world, that's evident
You're sayin' that you're gettin' it, then why you're so irrelevant
Essence is a mixture of not ever smokin' swishers
With a little liquor here and there, just to get the tippin'
Brown leaf whippin' down the middle like a zipper
Ain't nobody know your name, ain't nobody know you're livin'
#
"We heard, like, popping and we didn't know what it was and then I look out the window and there's this guy throwing, like, a pipe bomb at all the cars and then he came in the, they like, started blowing up and shooting everywhere in the cafeteria and then you just hear them laughing and running up the stairs..."

"...two young men who are according to students members of a group called the Trench Coat Mafia, barged through to the school, they were wearing masks and black coats and they opened fire with rifles..."

"...a gang within the school that a lot of witnesses have described as the Trench Coat Mafia and, uh, they have been described as an odd group of people but never, ever violent..."

"The first description by the way of the suspects was they they were wearing long coats, dark hats and some sort of masks."
#
My heart hurts, my back aches, I'm calling out for you
I see you, I need you more than you ever knew
I wanna know, 'cause we both been hurt before
Why your answer's no when I say, "I love you"
My heart hurts, my back aches, I'm calling out for you
I see you, I need you more than you ever knew
I wanna know, 'cause we both been hurt before
Why your answer's no when I say, "I love you, more"?
#
Everybody knows that I'm
The best around they don't even know why
I look like Bret Hart mixed with Dylan Klebold
Let me wet the propane in my eye
School shooter jacket with the wood grain blade
Butterfly strapped in the sock for the prey
Waiting and debating for the time and the day
I should unleash every single plan that I made
Plan that I made why aim for the head
Every kid and teacher that ever picked on me
Grip don't squeeze
I don't want to make you bleed
But I know what a scene you have seen when I leave
Crime scene when I leave in the woods when I flee
Back to the cabin with a smile on me
Dig another cellar then I'm ready for the weather
Bitch I'm coming down you better remember just what I'm telling
Get low when you see me come round
Better get down when you hear that sound
Pipe bomb blowin' in the loud background
Lifes get's snatched 'fore your body hits ground
#
You may have won this time
But I'm coming back for you
I know that it's the time
Can't let my plans fall on through
Look me in the eyes
Tell me what do you
See when you look inside
Who I am, who am I to you?
Drugs, drugs everywhere
Blunt smoke hanging in the air
The reason that I'm dying in my lungs
But I don't want to go, unless it's with you, girl

Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down
#
I don't want to wake, I don't want to sleep
I don't want to suffocate, I don't want to breathe
I don't want to drown, I don't want to sink
Deep, deep down to the bottom of the sea
The top of the mountain, snow on the peak
Bitch, I'm the creak in the floor when I creep
Teenage witch, I don't need a bitch
I don't want a chain, I don't need a whip
Still gettin' cash, still flickin' ash
See you actin' hard and I can't hold back
I need you to know, I don't want to see
I don't want to hear you talkin' bout me
#
Suicide Two-Tone
Bleedin' with the roof gone
Bloody like a newborn
Cutting like a coupon
Pulling on my tendons just to make the wheel turn
Strike a match with my teeth just to let the weed burn
Ash on my shirt, shoelace on my waist
Fiji water in my lap hydrated all day
SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ, live from the grave
Got my hair pinned back like the fucking Green Ranger
Young Criss Angel, trying to see my angle
Disappear in smoke then I'm cash for some days
Rubber shoe sole, feel the pressure on the pavement
Pussy trying to be me, just be thankful

Riding in a camouflaged Bronco
Looking like the white Benny Blanco
Blades on me, got your bitch growing legs
And running away like Ponyo, flow like my jaw broke

Tom Hanks, casting away
No shirt, no shoes, just blunts by the bay
Bales of the hay, snowflakes on the grave
That's life back home where regrets got made
Life got faced, windows got broke
Shit got took and shit got sold
'09 trucks in the yard
Brown Carhartts when the cold gets harsh
Up town, D19, bitch I'm coming out the dirt with a blade on me

Riding in a camouflaged Bronco
Looking like the white Benny Blanco
Blades on me, got your bitch growing legs
And running away like Ponyo, flow like my jaw broke
#
I hate everything, I hate everyone
I need to be alone, I don't need anyone
Tell me what to say, tell me what to say
When I'm in your way, when I'm in your way
You don't gotta throw me down, there's another way
But you did, I guess we'll try again another day
Leave a permanent frown on your mothers face
Your life's nice 'til you don't wanna be nice to me
I don't understand at all
Maybe I never will
#
Rip my heart up through my chest
Rip the veins up out my flesh
Put the dope in the wood
Couldn't flow if you could
Still thinking that you the best
You say you got them fans, but at your show they just stand
You say you got them bands, but you still living with your dad
Young Dylan Klebold
Verse full of keynotes
Bombs in the Lunchroom, teenage freak show
I ain't loading guns, I'm rolling up some blunts
I got life up in my glass, I got death up in my lungs
What, wait...

I hurt everyone
I don't deserve anyone
I will let you down
In the end, I'll let you down
#
Drinking like I'm Julian, pull up to the school and then
Heard a loud pop, saw the students they were shooting at
Blood on the sidewalk, heart beating fast now
Thought it was a joke til I saw the TEC-9's out
Chalk outlines now, sounds of the crime loud
Helicopters, parents crying, fear is alive now
Body count raise as the cops sit and wait
Too scared to go in, maybe see their final day
The wind pickin' up, bodies getting laid down
Say the music, say the parents, but who the fuck's to blame now?
Nobody, no cops thinking "Hey, maybe, probably, we should go in the building, we could save a couple lives"
Fuck it, rather stay outside where it's safe
Hundred twenty minutes later now they 'bout to save the day
Tears of the town til my neck 'bout to drown
Head up, eyes closed, I don't wanna hear a sound

The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of your touch
The breath in your lungs is the death of your son
It's the love of your life, it's the loss of the touch
#
Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy
White trash, white trash, blame that shit on Michigan
Troubled youth, troubled youth, mama gon' be missin me
Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy

I ain't ridin round in no Lamborghinis
Can't fuck with me like a bitch on her period
Can't fuck with me like a bitch and that's period
In the pickup, bumpin' sesh, sippin artesian
I'm a young dumb fuck with a bad attitude
Like a rifle, I raise it and aim it at you
Great head of hair and a velvet voice
I just look like death sitting in on my corpse

Witch boy, witch boy, creepin' out the Styx boy
Long hair, long hair, lookin' like a bitch boy
White trash, white trash, blame that shit on Michigan
Troubled youth, troubled youth, mama gon' be missin me
Witch boy, witch boy
#
As I speak, as I talk
I see your lies, I hear your thoughts
As we breathe, as we go
Down this road that we call hope
Take my hand, hold it tight
Never let go, no matter what I say
Forgive your son, forgive your life
I can't forgive myself tonight

My eyes shut tight as I'm runnin' for my life
My eyes shut tight as I'm runnin' for my life
#
Walkin' down the dirt roads, fingers intertwined
Let's get lost together, fingers crossed they'll never find us
Lying on our backs in the summer grass
We were thirteen, time's movin' way too fast
Thought we knew it all, I was so sure I did
I want to die without you, you make me want to live
I want to know
Will you hold me close
#
Congratulation ! you won

Propane pipe bombs
Flash like Nikons
Young dead suicidal superstar icon
I make them nervous, like the image of me lurkin'
In the halls with the weapon, only purpose is to murder
Now you didn't mean it
You tell me you were kiddin'
Read the plans in my notebook and see why I did it
Two hours 'fore the cops come
In, now it's locked down
Everybody runnin' like some fiends when the cops 'round
Smokin' in my trench coat
Waitin' for my next go
Water comin' down from the sprinklers on my neck froze
Let's go, next door
Then the cafeteria
My mind is in a trance, my ears are locked out, I am not hearin' ya
I'm feelin' somethin' like Eric
But I'm lookin' just like Dylan
Just another white trash kid with his mind battled
All he ever wanted to do was kill 'em
These boys act tough 'til they ribs erupt
Leave ya body in the library next to ya favorite book
What

I don't like you (You)
I don't like you (You)
I'll give you to the count of ten
For you to start running again
We just could've been friends
But you decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
Decided to hurt me
#
It's to the point where I don't know who I am
I'm at a place where I don't think no one cares
Bruise my skin, throw my bag down the stairs
Look me in my eyes and say you don't care
I've got some problems, I know that you've got yours
I'm not special, I'm nothing to adore
I drown myself with every lie that I told
I'll probably be this way until I'm old

Listen up bitches, does anyone know the truth here?
I've been around and around and around and everyone fucking lies to me
And if anyone thinks I'm an idiot, come and find me, I wanna kill you
I smoke so much that I don't think that it's good for me
But I don't give a fuck (FUCK THE POLICE)
If you know a police officer tell 'em I said fuck him, bitch
And that's just the way it fucking is, bitch
#
I could have been a lawyer, I could have been a doctor
But I don't give a fuck about helpin' out others
You act like you be snappin', you say that you're the hardest
But you don't fool nobody, you're a pussy like your father
A bitch just like your mom, a wreck just like your home
I know you feel alone, so know I will not go
I know you feel alone, I know you feel me here
I'm sittin' right beside you, everything is okay
#
Find another way
Can't go in your room
Your bed is still unmade
Find another way
Can't go in your room
Your bed is still unmade
#
What if everything around you
What
Isn't quite as it seems?
Bones
What if all the world you think you know
Is an elaborate dream?

Dead like I'm Earnhardt, dope up in the dashboard
Smokin' like a Nascar, ash on the asphalt
Dirty fingernails, two pigtails
Bitch I look like Sandra Bullock
Rollin' bones, speakin' spells
We don't like you, if you really couldn't tell
Your shows ain't shit and your flows ain't real
Your words ain't true and your style is the same
If you can't be yourself you deserve to die today
Drive away

Now my tires get to burnin'
Wheels get to turnin'
Bones get to swervin'
Now my tires get to burnin'
Wheels get to turnin'
Bones get to swervin'
#
Purified water in my glass, let me hydrate
Young white trash, eyes low like I'm 5'8"
Ground starts to vibrate, grass starts to separate
Soil starts to plummet to the core of my fucking grave
Diamonds in my eyes, I got jewels on me
Get your body lifted if you try to fool on me
But just know I ain't alone, just know I ain't alone
Got a hundred scumbags that'll kill just for Bones
Lookin' like you seen a ghost when you're looking at me
Body full of chemicals so it's hard for me to breathe
Hard drive saved, Macintosh, bitches say I'm actin' posh
Say I'm not thirsty if the water ain't a fuckin' Voss

I will ride 'til the day that I die
I will ride 'til the day that I die
#
I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways

You say you banging like Marvin, Gaye's father, be honest
You acting hard, sellin' dope, like I ain't got enough on me
Say you strapped like the army, claim you spraying the Tommy
I'm just a corpse on the porch, there's no way you can harm me
See I already passed, now I'm in a better place
With a fountain and some pillars and my girl to feed me grapes
If you thinking death is bad, let me tell you that it's great
Come and pay me a visit, I'm in the grave by the lake

I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways

Young Kevin Nash, just a victim of this cash
If the money make us choose, just make sure we make it back
Just make sure we make it flip, just make sure we make it last
Flow, roll, smoke, breathe, speak, creep and make it stack
Now she dead on the floor, now I'm ready to go
See, I don't like a bitch if she like Anna Nicole
Fubu on my velour, it's the prince of the sewers
See, it's the lord of the rats, no shirt, no shoes
What?

I'm just a dead boy, got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways
I'm just a dead boy, I got no blood in my veins
I'm just a dead boy, just so stuck in my ways

The things you do, is amazing
The way you move, it amaze me
Now what to do, now I love you
So baby you

You can be
My everything

My everything

My everything
You can be
My everything
My everything
My everything

My everything
My everything

It's the wi-fi pimp, modems hangin' from my wrists
Passwords on my blunts, got to log in to get it (You've got mail)
Digits etched on my grave, can't decipher my slang
Wingdings when I speak, bold fonts when I sing
Bitch, I'm comin' through italicized, that's leanin' back
Backseat, chargin' up my MacBook (You've got mail) up on my lap (You've got mail)
Bitch, my signal always strong and my bandwidth smooth
Rollin' coffins and coughin' until I roll a new
Flash drive blade, plug it in your veins
Downloadin' lives, then I right-click save
Got a 101 CD-changer, Ikea couch with the Sharper Image razor
101 CD-changer, (You've got mail) Ikea couch with the Sharper Image razor

Loadin', loadin', bitch, I'm loadin'
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Loadin', loadin', bitch, I'm loadin'
But that's the life of a G, I guess
But that's the life of a G, I guess

"Could you lower those signs, please? I have some very sad news for all of you, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight. Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort."

See, I could make the world crazy from the sound of a drop
You tryin' to calm me like Bobby when MLK got shot
See El feelin' like Slim back when Wayne got hot
And everybody thinkin', "Damn, will he change or not?"
I been the same every day and that's my biggest fuckin' downfall
Say they fuck with me but can't name a fuckin' album
Sayin' that they bought one, I've yet to fuckin' sell one
Say they love me but they don't know Elmo
I don't want a outcome, that's the fuckin' thing
They waitin' on labels, labels waitin' on me
Wantin' the change from the beats to the names
Rather nickel-dime every meal than be in the game
Fuck you, fuck rap and fuck hip-hop
Like I really give a fuck if I'm hot or not
No car, no chains, I ain't fuckin' all these bitches
Still, life so sweet and I don't even fuck with Swishers

Backwoods guts on my shoes, never playin' by the rules
Why you workin' on school? I'm higher than you ever been
Welcome to my tomb, welcome to my world
Comin' down clean, I'mma take your girl
Ridin' on blades, bitch, I'm cashed, hundred blunts to the face
#
Either I'm slidin' through in that fuckin' coupe
Or I'm rollin' dope on my fuckin' stoop
But either way it's ok we can get it anyday
See I light the blunt and then I lose the roof
My drugs kill 'em like homicide
Eyes replaced with them dollar signs
They get on board let alone the grind
I've been searching all night and I've yet to find
Another one like I
Team like mine
We feed em' drugs and we watch em' die
I never talk, I never walk
I'm posted smokin' should I let it spark
I'm steady hoping that you trynna bark
I got dogs in the yard, bitch make the call
Let 'em off the chain and come down like rain
And wash you and your whole dead team away

Thunder and lightning, it's storming outside
See that it's Bones so you cannot just hide
See that it's SESH so you cannot deny
If you don't abide, get ready to die
Thunder and lightning, it's storming outside
See that it's Bones so you cannot just hide
See that it's SESH so you cannot deny
If you don't abide get ready to die
Ready to die, ready to die
If you don't abide get ready to die

"Ay yo man, we bringing back the real knowledge
The real power in hip-hop
We are the streets, the movement
Hot street single smash"

We were sixteen, this means robbing was an option
Money was the problem, scrapping copper for some profit
Break it in for some gin, hope your mom don't got a problem
Throw the bottle over the fence, and I hope nobody saw us
We were gone, we were dead, resurrect and go to bed
Just some dirty white boys with some drugs up in our hands
Never slanging dope, no, cause we'd rather just smoke
Ice cold, back roads, tires covered in snow
I'm taking it back to the basics, I'm bringing it back to the basement
See this that Christmas light shining, hundred one blunts to the face, shit
See I was fifteen, drinking like I was fucking thirty-two
All the things you and your friends do, I did that too
Broken glass, blunt ash, dashing away with the product
Peep it, flip it for some dollars, then we buy some more bottles
Our parents thinking that we missing, haven't spoken some weeks
My shoes wet from the weather, hiding out from the heat

I'm just a young bad kid, wasn't meant to do shit
I did things I wish I didn't, I got things I wish I did
Just a young bad kid, wasn't meant to be shit
I did things I wish I didn't, I got things I wish I did

Feeling something like Jermaine Dupri
Jagged Edge I'm with the twisted team
White and cold, I'm like Mr. Freeze
But I'm looking something like Keanu Reeves
I switch the blade and she pop a bean
Heart stop and she drop to knees
She smell the smoke and she know it's SESH
She see my eyes and she know it's me, like damn
Did it really all change that quick
Now everywhere we go they know us
I wanna stop time, I don't wanna go on any longer
Just give me a moment
#
I'm ready to go
Cause I just want to see you again
I'm ready to go, I just need to see you, friend
I don't want to go, if you're not right there
I don't want to go, no I don't want to go
I don't want to go, don't want to go
Don't want to go

Bag of dope on the table, million blunts, now I'm able
Strung out in my living room, Netflix, no cable
Fresh water I drink, just fillin' up my HP
Boys close, weed to smoke, our raps are everything free
I'm feelin' something like Joe Dirt, old jeans, no shirt
Singin' like a white Ginuwine, only difference is my flow is perfect

I'm ready to go
Cause I just want to see you again
I'm ready to go, I just need to see you, friend
I don't want to go, if you're not right there
I don't want to go, no I don't want to go
I don't want to go, don't want to go
Don't want to go

Everybody say the same shit, ridin' with the same clique
Fuckin' with the same bitch, so I keep my distance
This is the difference to me and you, listen
The money come and go, but to me that never meant shit
Smokin' on the same blunts, bitch you're still the same punk
Put my parents through some shit, now I got to make it up
Wakin' up, rollin' up, backstage smokin' up
Crowds get to showin' up, now it's time to show 'em what
Bones really do, motherfuck your whole crew
Just some pussies online, act like rap is what you do
Never been no one to stop, dropped out, now what
Now I'm paid for some days, just for rappin' on the spot
What
#
Steppin' out the crib like it's 1986
T-top Trans Am, ridin' with your bitch
Take her to the point, drive her back off in the morning
Just a young fuckin' stud, flick my hair then I'm rollin'
I got drugs if you want to feel the high
Backwoods if you want to catch the sky
Perfect mowed lawns, architecture, no flaws
Just a calm, safe neighborhood, tucked behind the mall
Parents go to work, probably think that I'm at school
But the music's got into me and it took away my soul
I just want to rock, headbanging to the ‘knot
Bitch I Bawitdaba, never callin' it off
Never fallin' at all, never worry 'bout a thing
Everything is just peaches, I'm smokin' in the breeze
Sittin' in the shade underneath the weepin' willow
Blunt guts on the grass, unraveling cigarillos
And I think

Now this is really nice
Breathin' in the dope, watch the clouds roll by
This can't be real life
Everything's a dream, I don't need to shut my eyes
Now this is really nice
Drugs on fire, cold water on ice
This can't be real life
Look me in my eyes, tell me that you'll stay the night
#
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know which way to go
Walking down the road
Lookin' at the streetlights
Wanna go home, but I don't feel right
Spend my days at the river, spend my nights in the forest
Wakin' up to birds screamin' like I've been here before
See the day I get my license Imma have somethin for ya
If you come here with the issue, know I got somethin' for you
I got that butterfly blade, I don't got no hundreds on me
I don't got a damn thing to lose, if you're not with me

Smoking dope in my Adidas suit
Drop it, I don't need a roof
Look you in the eyes like all I truly need is you
Bathe in the sea, then I'm back into the cave
Bitch, it's SESH a.k.a the reason that you ain't the greatest
What
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait (Sesh)
Bones
Sesh
Sesh
What

I don't know, I don't know
I don't know which way to go
Walking down the road
Lookin' at the streetlights
Wanna go home, but I don't feel right
Spend my days at the river, spend my nights in the forest
Wakin' up to birds screamin' like I've been here before
See the day I get my license Imma have somethin for ya
If you come here with the issue, know I got somethin' for you
I got that butterfly blade, I don't got no hundreds on me
I don't got a damn thing to lose, if you're not with me
#
Locked in my grave, I ain't slept in days
Worms in my blunt, I got mud up in my veins
Cemetery legend, poppin' like Excedrin
I'm on it smoking heavy, at this rate I'll be high forever
You speakin' like a reverend, then acting like a felon
These conscious rap pussies ain't in no place help us
No position to tell me, how the worship be
Bitch get you some money, get the fuck up off the street

Bringing it all the way back, bitch
Sippin' it off my flask, bitch
Creepin' up with that blade
Better bust quick when you see that SESH shit
Wreck shit what I'mma do do, motherfuck your Bentley coupe
Time after time, Cyndi Lauper back in '82
Comin' down clean in a new machine
Drugs on deck and the money on me
Styrofoam cup and I don't sip lean
I just need a place to go but I want my weed
Leave me alone, I just need to fucking breathe
I'm just sick of all these trash every day I fucking see
So I lock the fucking door and keep myself up in the dark
I can see you, I can hear you, I don't even want to start
I don't care about your music, I don't care about your lord
Throw my body in the trash when my time's cut short

And that's for real, real
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, feel
And that's for real, real
And that's for real, real

Okay, you swerve in the Lexus, I pull up with your next bitch
O2' Wayne, cash money on the necklace
Always on the guestlist, oh and not to mention
Pick my worst song, bet it's harder than your best shit
I don't need a Tec clip to depress the tension
My lungs at recess, my heart is in detention
Start in the sense in the sense that I'm making
It's breaking and shaking you down in the pavement
Old and you're basic, I'm young and amazing
Chain never hanging, I'm gripping on a razor
Feel it with anger, zone turns danger
Friends turn strangers and words get fame

And that's for real, real
Don't give a fuck about how you feel, feel
And that's for real, real
And that's for real, real

Young Jonathan Taylor Thomas, ridin' in a hummer
See, bitches like Joe they see me they start to stutter
I'm sittin' on butter. I'm smokin' til the sun up
And then I roll another and let it burn like Usher
Jenny from the block looking bitch just stop
You thinkin that you hard but you just a fuckin bop
You'll never get respect, they'll never cut the check
Bitch, don't hold your breath less you wanna meet death
I got a new blade, I'm tryna break it in
I'm hopin' that you come up with some shit so we can get it
See BONES let em' have it
I'm creepin through the alley
I hit the blunt once, and fly away like Lenny Kravitz
See, I ain't even rappin'
See, flowin's just a habit
I hope you know what happens if you try to bring me static
I'm cuttin' off the lights, you runnin' for your life
But really you just runnin' til you run into my knife
Dark cold forest, precipitation pourin'
See just because you dyin', doesn't mean that you're important
Nobody gon' miss ya, I promise give it time
The memory of you will slowly fade up in they mind
Your room gets changed, your clothes put away
There's nothing like you left it and it hurts to even breathe
The smile on your parents just as fake as their intentions
They're sayin' that you'll make it, but they know you'll never make it

I'm rollin' fast, I'm smokin' slow
I'm gettin' cash, I'm blowin' smoke
I'm rollin' fast, I'm smokin' slow
I'm gettin' cash, I'm blowin' smoke
#
(What?)
Ridin' round while I'm dopin' up
When I knock you better open up
One million blunts and I smoke enough
I'm just a young white punk steady rolling up
Smokin' down, pass away
She need an ash so I pass the tray
She OD, she owe me, she know it's Bones so she feel the blade
Slowly fade, drugs slowly burn
Blinds closed, she got more to learn
Skeletons in my closet, it's a graveyard in my room
I feel like Cousin Skeeter when I'm ridin' in a Beamer
Bitches on my steelo cause I look just like Aaliyah
Ridin' off in the yacht (yacht)
Swimmin' pool on top (top)
Rollin' up on the deck, blowin' smoke up on the dock
It's the slim young pimp, 20 beepers on my hip
Candy paint, let it drip, like the rain from the winds (What?)

Wakin' up cryin', Wakin' up cryin' for you
What else can I do?
I'm soakin' my pillows through
Wakin' up cryin'
Wakin' up cryin', Wakin' up cryin' for you
What else can I do?
I'm soakin' my pillows through
Wakin' up cryin'
Wakin' up cryin', Wakin' up cryin' for you
What else can I do?
I'm soakin' my pillows through
Wakin' up cryin'
Wakin' up cryin', Wakin' up cryin' for you
What else can I do?
I'm soakin' my pillows through
Wakin' up cryin'

If you go, please come back
I don’t know, how to act
When you’re not here with me
I go crazy,  I lose my head, I can’t see
When you’re not here with me
I hope you see, I need you in my sheets
If you go, please come back
I don’t know, how to act
When you’re not here with me
I go crazy,  I lose my head, I can’t see
When you’re not here with me
I hope you see, I need you in my sheets

2003
In the black Benz Jeep
With my Nextel phone
Your bitch calling me
The return of the Creep
Don't eat, don't sleep
All I do is drugs
And they always free
Got the blade on me
Shame on you if you hating on me
Just a young white boy with the game on freeze
If it gets to cold, put the blame on me
Smoking dope, talking on the mobile phone
They think they know me, but they only know it's fucking Bones

Na$ty mothafuckin' Matt
What, What, What
2005
Bitches all the way live
Fuck her like her tubes tied
Ridin' Nissan with the a machete on my side
Return of the fuckin' mack
Return of the Dirtbag
Used to have black mags on the Diamondback
Young Matt didn't know how to act
Young fuckin' grunga stepping out the fuckin' Caprice
Jeans cut around the knees
Big titty bitch on the seats
Concrete camouflage, with all this fuckin' grey
Fuck with me the wrong way, feel the wrath of my fuckin' blade
#
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about
What happened to me
But it’s hard to stay mad
When there’s so much beauty in the world
Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once
And it’s too much;
My heart fills up like a balloon
That’s about to burst
And then I remember to relax
And stop trying to hold onto it
And then it flows through me like rain
And I can’t feel anything but gratitude —
For every single moment of my stupid, little life

Got that dope and I got that flow
Anything change, still the same ol' Bones
Somewhere in the dark is a boy you know
If you know me I don't talk 'til the blunt gets smoked
Thugs from the front to the back, let's go
Jam like a white vintage Les Paul
Tear 'ya club down and watch it in slo-mo
Then I ash on the wreckage and I'm walkin' out the door like

Boom (Boom)
Put it in the hoop like slam (slam)
Hear the crowd screamin' our jam (jam)
Bones too cold that's a fact (what?)
And that's how I beat Shaq
Boom (Boom)
Put it in the hoop like slam (slam)
Hear the crowd screamin' our jam (jam)
Bones too cold that's a fact (what?)
And that's how I beat Shaq

Wakin' in my room like a quarter to 8
Wonderin' what I'll do to kill the world today
Then I roll my first bone, then I'm into shape, knowin' damn well I'ma make my ends today
I ain't worried 'bout makin' no friends today
If you see it as a problem come and instigate
If you know me you don't wanna make this mistake
See I was bred to hate and I was built to break
Talk like this, try to walk like this
Say my shit don't bang, then you bite that shit
Rewrite that shit, change a couple of the words
That's your whole mixtape down to the core
Sorry
Didn't mean to do it to 'em
Since '94, all I do is do it to 'em
All I see on the radar is me
Me and my brothers, that's SESH 'til I leave
#
Screen up in the dash like I'm fucking Mike Jones
281-330-8004
All my friends are black, now I feel like Paul Wall
Looking like a school shooter when I’m walking through the halls
I got friends that don’t call, I got friends that don’t talk
You don’t want it bitch I promise, leave your body to the wolves
I’m creeping cause I’m cool, smoking like it's all I do
Booming like Macaulay Culkin back in 1992

"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator."
#
"The wind, invisible, powerful, mysterious
The rain, touching your hair, your face, your heart
The snow falls and something inside is a child again
The sun shines and the whole world seems to smile
Because the weather means more to you than umbrellas and overcoats
We bring you the weather channel, weather you can always turn to"

I don't even want you to pay me any attention
I got my own shit and you are merely a distraction
I'm not blind but I ignore you in similar fashion
I got no love, I got no love, not even just a fraction

Fuck a brand name bitch I rock my own shit
Fuck these other rappers bitch I bump my own shit
I'm all alone, singing at the bottom of the ocean
I'm in my zone, can't nobody tell me no shit
No bills, still I'm looking like I own shit
Young Bones, and I'm back up on that flow shit
That 'bob your head, roll your blunt, get gone' shit
Never pay for clothes; I never owe shit

I don't even want you to pay me any attention
I got my own shit and you are merely a distraction
I'm not blind but I ignore you in similar fashion
I got no love, I got no love, not even just a fraction
#
Where were you when my world was burning down
You say you'd be here but you're nowhere to be found
Nowhere to be found except in my memories
I hope you cannot breathe every time that you think of me
I'm walking all alone down the road that I used to go
I'm looking all around, I see faces that I don't know

Take me away
Cut off my circulation
I don't want to be here if you're not
Cut off my circulation
I don't want to be here if you're not
#
Throw me in the water, watch me sink to the bottom
Then hold on to my belongings ‘cause you can’t live without them
You keep saying that you love me but what you don’t know about me
Is that I don’t even love myself so how the fuck could I love you?
I don’t need no guns to back me up, I don’t need your love if you got to try
All I really need is nothing, see this life is just a lie
My favorite time is when it’s me in the dark with a beat
Bad thoughts in my head, blunt guts at my feet
Got my blade in the right and some drugs up in my left
Love the sound of the silence I just wish it would never end

Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
When the air gets cold know that Bones is on your block
See the lights down, bass loud, everything stop
It’s the young living legend with another fucking drop

Back up in the fucking flow
I ain’t gripping on the scope
I ain’t pimping fucking hoes
I ain’t riding in the Rolls
Looking like a fucking ghost
Gliding like a fucking bat
Doping on the fucking porch
It’s best you do not come with that

Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
When the air gets cold know that Bones is on your block
Lights down, bass loud, everything stop
It’s the young living legend with another fucking drop

"OK, I just want to warn you that, uh, when I wrote this song...
I was listening to The Cure a lot, so...

Waiting till I fade away
It's coming any day
You don't need to come my way
I'm not worth it anyway (worth it anyway)
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna breathe
If you're not here with me
I don't wanna breathe, I don't wanna breathe
If you're not here with me

If you're not here, I don't want to be
If you're not here I don't want to...

"He's losing his mind
And I'm reaping all the benefits"
#
Spacedtime

The streets that I grew up on is probably changed by now
The house that I grew up in is owned by somebody that I don't know
The places that I used to go
You cannot see them
They are covered in snow

Covered in snow
Covered in snow
Covered in snow
Covered in snow

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
#
I look like Eric Harris, but you've never seen me bangin'
I died up on the cross and I was buried in the manger
If you brought some danger just speak up then you get hammered
Doing damage, never panic, this ain't nothing for the labels

Coming down while I'm rolling up
Artesian water when I'm pouring up
I'm clean as fuck, but I'm mean as fuck
I got the blade on me if you runnin' up
I'll drown myself in that blunt smoke
Take shelter in dark flows
Never see the sun because I'm on the moon
Locked away, forever in my tomb

Tryin' to make this money flow like waterfalls
Whatever you do, know I'll be there no matter what the cause
Whatever you see, just know I'll love you till we pass away
Wherever you go, know I'll be right here if you needing me
#
I was looking for someone and I thought it was you
I've been waiting for some time, waiting here for you
But I haven't seen any fucking body
So I guess that I'll just sit in my room and wait
I don't need anybody's love
I don't need anybody's words
I think I'll be okay on my own now
I think it's best if I go now...

You think you'll miss me but I promise you won't
You think you love me but you know that you don't

Third eye open and telling me I’m numb
Find me tripping on cemetery love
Girls like me 'cause I look like Bones
Triple six fiending like California clones
See me shut up
Tell me nothing
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner
Eyes like crystal
Stone cold stunner

Riding in the drop with no roof on the top
I don't wanna go but I know I gotta stop
What do I have to do
To show you that I love you
I've been sinking
I've been drowning
Please come save me
I need you badly
#
Ride or die
Suicide when I'm slidin' by
Dollar signs in my fucking eyes
Cock the blade back, and let it fly
Rolling, smoking, doping all day
Fuck with Bones and learn the hard way
Hallway, darkening, blunts so sparking
Lurking, certain that I'm harder
Glasshouse, metal door
Lavish living to the core
Diamond fridge, platinum sink
Marble counter, granite floor
Boyfriends hate me, bitches love me
Drinking nice and smoking lovely
Sitting pretty looking gorgeous
Every line is fucking flawless

Everything I do is flawless
Bling-bling, golden ring like it's calling
Every time I smoke it's flawless
Perfect rolled woods, perfect groomed garden
Everything I do is flawless
Bling -bling, golden ring like it's calling
Every time I smoke it's flawless
Perfect rolled woods, perfect groomed garden

Everything I do is flawless
Bling -bling, golden ring like it's calling

Claire
Are you okay?
Claire
I think she took way to many pills
I think she's dead

I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home
I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home

Watch her overdose, now she on the floor
The room start to fade and now she dying real slow
Her heart beating fast, I’m blowing off the ash
Her body laying flat, whole life start to flash
Now it’s eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Who else want to step to Bones?
Put the chrome to my dome
Pull the trigger, send me home
Back up in the graveyard, banging like a AR
Bringing back the dead, to kill 'em again when the bass drop


I will wipe away my tears
I shut you out, I made it clear
Gonna move on on my own
All alone, I shall go home

I know

I never noticed, I turned the coldest on accident
I never noticed, I killed the game just practicing
Now let me know if, if you trynna’ smoke
I got drugs to roll and I got places to go
Hit the street just me and the moon in the sky
I don’t know why I don’t feel like I’m alive
Walking on pavement, slow, no racing
Fuck up out of my face trynna’ get up on our placement
You a pussy, you're afraid of your dreams
Everything you want, you don’t have what it takes
Only way you could is if you turned into me
But that will never happen so they’ll just stay dreams

Hear me in your sleep, feel me when you wake
Take me away to where nobody knows my name
Hear me in your sleep, feel me when you wake
Take me away to where nobody knows my name
#
Young and I’m handsome, looking like the Hansons
Mmm, bopping bitches, popping pills ‘til they dancing
I ain't romantic, I ain't lighting candles
Deathbound boy, bitch, I'm smoking on that cancer
Phone like me, dead so no answer
Razor in my reach, Bones hold it like a ransom
Walking work of art, so everybody glancing
Fine brush strokes, put the colors on the canvas
Smoking in the ocean, drinking on the shore
I feel like Bo Derek back in 1984
Step up to me wrong, get cut like a check
You bring your girl around, you gon' lose her like Beck
You got a little buzz, just know it won't last
You worried 'bout your image, me, I'm looking for the ash
You bringing up my past, it only make me laugh
See, I don't got shit to hide but go ahead and act
SESH 'til I rest, still I have my brother's back
Ain't nobody fucking with the team, that's a fact
My grandfather's ring, my father's old coat
I'm looking like both when I'm up here in my zone
You thinking that you're different, I hope you know you isn't
Nobody likes your album, me, I didn't even listen
I'm sticking to my pimping, my girl looking like Lizzie
McGuire, getting higher 'til the stars start to glisten

I don't know what you've been told
I just know you need to know
Nobody fucks with you
Ain't nobody fuck with you

Lemme see that blunt, lemme see that cup
Lemme see that liquor, lemme see those drugs
I need a high, I need it bad
I need it fast, I'm fiendin' bad

(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad
(Fiendin', fiendin') I'm fiendin' bad

Waking up, rolling up
Fall asleep while I'm doping up
Home alone, hold the phone
If I die, no one would know
If I try to keep holding on, maybe they'll think I'm a legend then (shit)
Maybe they'll think I'm a legend then

I’m cash bitch, salt water in my bath bitch
Candles lit, my dope rolled
I’m living life on that lavish shit
Rare stone cover the wall
Bamboo cover the floor
Body scrub made of diamonds
Shining while I clean my pores
Blade exfoliates, my brothers, they on the way
If you choose to fucking stay, you gonna’ be on First 48
My blood is full of drugs, you act like a fucking thug
We know you a fucking bitch, we know you a fucking scrub

Coming down clean, bitches know it’s me
Rolling up my weed, I don’t want to leave
Blade on me, I hope you’ll never try
I don’t want to be the reason that you die
Coming down clean, bitches know it’s me
Rolling up my weed, I don’t want to leave
Blade on me, I hope you’ll never try
I don’t want to be the reason that you die

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill
Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

I ain't at the club
I ain't at the bar
Bitch I'm in the streets
Sliding wit' the doors ajar
I ain't at the club
I ain't at the bar
Bitch I'm in the streets
Sliding wit' the doors ajar

Roof back and I'm flying
Blunt lit now I'm higher
Hanging out the fuckin' window
Screaming something like a siren
Artifacts look Mayan
Fresh shrimp, I'm frying
Bitch I'm always buying
Always slowly dying
Berries in the backyard
Apples in the front
Got some oranges in the side yard
Pick just what she want
Bitch I'm spittin' out the seeds
Feel the grass on my feet
(Ho I'm) laying in the clouds, lookin' up at the sea
Bitch I'm popping like a trunk, in the middle of the summer
In a parking lot bumpin'
See the trunk get to thumpin'
All these bitches know it's me
They see me with the team
They know it's fuckin' SESH

I ain't at the club
I ain't at the bar
Bitch I'm in the streets
Sliding wit' the doors ajar
I ain't at the club
I ain't at the bar
Bitch I'm in the streets
Sliding wit' the doors ajar

Wait, wait, wait, ride
Wait, wait, wait, slide
Wait, wait, wait, ride
Wait, wait, wait, slide
(Slide, slide)

What?
The weather's getting cold (cold)
The dope's getting sold (sold)
The block's getting high and this shit's getting old (old)
Skin feeling frozen my feet are feeling numb (numb)
Midwest boy in the blitz of rolling blunts (what?)
Chilling like I'm supposed to
All you boys is old news
Since I dropped out
This ain't old or new school
Doing what I used to
Never let em use you
Thinking 'bout you
And I hope I never lose you (hope I never)

It's 4 AM
Flowing slow, thinking fast
Moonlight shining, blunt ash on my hands (what?)
It's 4 AM
Flowing slow, thinking fast
Moonlight shining, blunt ash on my hands

Every night I hear a sound
When it rains I hear it loud
Flying high above the ground
I don't ever wanna go down
Every time I say your name
I feel a rush in my veins
Every time I say I love you
I feel like you're the only person that I really know
I wish that we could go
To a place back years
I wish that I could show
That's how I feel about you

Baby won't you run with me
Its easy as 1 2 3
Together for eternity
Everything you want I need
Baby won't you run with me
Its easy as 1 2 3

We could talk it, We could talk it out
We could talk it, We could talk it out
I hear them talking but they ain't saying much
I'm just rolling up these blunts
I hear them talking but they ain't saying much
So I'm just rolling these blunts all night
So I'm just rolling up these blunts

Hey guys its really crazy out here a lot of people showing enthusiasm for shes-, for sesh, oh god like you hear the fans like they are loving every minute of it, yeah. We have a couple people 'bout to get on stage soon headlining is of course our man Bones, uhh


Walking down the road
Don't know where to go
Walking down the road
Don't know where to go
Bitches know its Bones
Running up from home


The next song on the playlist from sesh radio is an unreleased song from bones called TimeshareCondominium




Steppin' out the crib like it's 1986
T-top Trans Am, ridin' with your bitch
Take her to the point, drive her back off in the morning
Just a young fuckin' stud, flick my hair then I'm rollin'
I got drugs if you want to feel the high
Backwoods if you want to catch the sky
Perfect mowed lawns, architecture, no flaws
Just a calm, safe neighborhood, tucked behind the mall
Parents go to work, probably think that I'm at school
But the music's got into me and it took away my soul
I just want to rock, headbanging to the 'knot
Bitch I ball with the ball, never callin' it off
Never fallin' at all, never worry 'bout a thing
Everything is just peaches, I'm smokin' in the breeze
Sittin' in the shade underneath the weepin' willow
Blunt guts on the grass, unravelin' cigarillos
And I think

Now this is really nice
Breathin' in the dope, watch the clouds roll by
This can't be real life
Everything's a dream, I don't need to shut my eyes
Now this is really nice
Drugs on fire, cold water on ice
This can't be real life
Look me in my eyes, tell me that you'll stay tonight


Hi there this is Bobby Hollowfax on 302.6. The SeshRadio bringing you all of the Sesh hits from the early 2000s to the later 2000s right now were going to be taking some of your calls right we have now Pamela from Riverside on line one Pamela, whats up?

*Mumbling*

And another satisfied caller definately a fan of sesh you could tell by her tone of voice so next we're going to get into another new one off of the new sesh tape


I'm the old photograph that puts the chills in your spine
I'm the sound of your mother's voice saying it's alright
I'm the simplistic beauty like the world when you were five
Everything you know now, wanna delete it out your mind
You just wanna go back, wanna get away
You try your hardest but your heart is just gon' make you stay
Burning dope in the moonlight
Everything your father said you'll see is coming true tonight

Both eyes closed
Looking like a work of art chiseled out of stone
I don't wanna go

Both eyes closed
Looking like a work of art chiseled out of stone
I don't wanna go

I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't tryin'  to be the best, I did it on accident
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't even tryin' to act, I ain't even tryin' to rap

If I did you would know, if I did it would show
No sweat, no check, bitch it's all that I know
I could flow, I could go, I could bring it back slow
I could make you stop rapping with the fucking video
Know it’s SESH when you see the VHS start glitchin'
Still the Skinny White Pimp, I'm just sick of all the bitchin'
Promo till you go but you still never blow
You ain't good you ain't hood, you ain't 'bout what you talk
Man the fuck up, bitch, make some motherfucking noise
Just because you got a microphone don't mean you going hard
Just because you hit record doesn't mean you made a song
All your shit sounds like mine, just a bad version
Right now you just a pussy online tryna push it
Stop wasting all your time, should've listened to your mom
When she told you get a job, fuck it, maybe you already do
But stay the fuck up off the mic until you're fucking ready to

I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't tryin'  to be the best, I did it on accident
I ain't tryin' to be white, I ain't tryin' to be black
I ain't even tryin' to act, I ain't even tryin' to rap

Live my life as if I'm dying tonight
Do what I want until they turn off the lights
I know that you're waiting for me to say the words
But I don't think you deserve my time
I got some drugs in my veins and the blade in my hand
Everybody know my name, I don't gotta say a thing
Everyone tryna be me but I'm the only one that can
Everybody tryna go hard but I'm the only one that can

On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you there
On the other side, I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you, waiting for you

I don't give a shit about shit
But my clique and that's it
Hollow squad captain, nigga fuck the bullshit
Talk shit and get hit if you feel like it, bitch
Fuck nigga, yeah you know it's me, Wulfgang, killer till the E-N-D when I D-I-E
Find me in your sleep, till you D-I-E
Fuck with me and never rest in peace, bitch
Hanakasumi
Always all up on me
Plot on me and be harmed
I don't give no warnings
I'll cut you dead and go home
Then I'll smoke all night long
I told my squad to prolong
We got war in the morning

Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up

Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up
Mosh pits in the club
Fuck with me, I'll fuck you up

You could never fuck with me
You could never run from me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street
Riding up your fucking street
I don't need no fucking heat
I don't need a fucking Glock to take away your fucking dreams
You could never take my life
Bitch, cus' I'm already dead
Always with my brothers
Try to run up, lose your fucking head
Blood up on the floor
I hear ghosts knocking at my door
I hear screams from the past
Just ignore them and keep on going, bitch

You could never fuck with me
You could never fuck with me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street
You could never fuck with me
You could never fuck with me
Blood up on my switchblade
Riding up your fucking street

What, what
Sesh, Bones
What, what
What, sesh

Where were you when my nights were dark and cold?
Where were you when I felt all alone?
Is anybody out there?
I hope that you're hearing me
I hope that you truly know
Just how much you mean to me
Just how much you mean to me

Is anybody out there?
I hope that you're hearing me
I hope that you truly know
Just how much you mean to me
Every night when I would call your name
I would dream just to see your face
Every night when I would call your name
I would dream just to see your face

I don't need a God
All I need is me
I don't need no God
All I need is me
I can never trust again (x8)

I could live

Eyes like the moon, got a body like a tomb
If she die then I die too, bitch, I'll see you soon
Ice cold in my room, got frost on my sheets
Call me Mr. Ten Below, last thing I need is heat
If you catch me all alone, better speak up when you see me
I don't like to hold grudges, but I like to hold a beat
It's the corner store creep, black jeans, white tee
Bitch, I feel like Johnny Depp when I'm steppin' on the scene
I'm the young white hope, bitch, I'm going, going ghost
You can try 'til you die but you'll never be Bones
I been dopin' all day, flickin' ash all night
Wrinkled clothes on my body, I been dirty all my life
I don't even need a knife to cut you out of the picture
I drown in liquor, fuck a Swisher, Backwoods what I'm twistin'
I'm like the remix to Ignition, bitch, I'm better than all of you bitches
Top off the whip, I'm flickin' the switch, then I go back into the abyss
Back to the grave, life is a game
Death ain't a option, it win every day
Fuck gettin paid, fuck gettin laid
I'd rather be alone, I'm smokin' my haze
Back to the grave, life is a game
Death ain't a option, it win every day
Fuck it, it pay, fuck it, it lay
I'd rather be alone, I'm smokin' my haze

Walking all alone on every road I grew up on
Guess a lot of things have changed since I've been gone
Guess a lot of things have changed since I've been gone

Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone
Don’t know where I’m going
Don’t know where I’m heading
All I know is one thing and that’s I need you
Rolling up dope as I’m pushing up the interstate
Wanna go home but I keep it moving anyway
I just need you to wait for me
I’m pulling up to your house now
Baby I just need your faith in me
I can’t do this all alone

Everybody wants a reason for everything
It’s so much easier with someone or something to blame
I’ve always struggled at the root of the problem
Has it been absence, or my constant lack of defense
I’ve never spent a lot on finding the remedy
I guess I figured that it hurt for a reason I guess
That’s why I’ve always turned to writing it down
#
[Instrumental]
#
Nothing else to do
Locked up in my room with some thoughts of you
Nothing else to lose
Shut my eyes, slit my wrists, take my life for you

I'm dying for your love
I'm waiting for your call
I'm waiting by my phone
I hope you call me soon

Bring me to life
Make it all okay
You're the only one that can
Bring me to life
Throw it all away
Bury me, just bury me tonight

I'm dying for your love
I'm waiting for your call
I'm waiting by my phone
I hope you call me soon

Bring me to life
Make it all okay
You're the only one that can
Bring me to life
Throw it all away
Bury me, just bury me tonight

Water dripping from the leaves
Rolling up all my weed, winds ripping through the trees
Rain dropping from the sky
Memories on my mind, chills slithering up my spine
Doping while I'm smoking and I'm flowing while I'm rolling
Xay told me tell 'em so I told him

Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down

Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day

Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down
Rain coming down, puddles on the ground
Rolling in the street lights, windows down

I don't know
I'm worthless
I don't know
You don't deserve this

No guns, no guns, just a young, dumb fuck
Troubled boy makin' noise rollin' young, dumb blunts
I don't got no diamonds in my teeth
I don't got no lean up in my glass
All I do is roll my dope just to help the time pass
Young Gordon Bombay, got these blades on me
Got some ice up in my veins make the whole world freeze
What?
Gorgeous

I don't know
I'm worthless
I don't know
Do you deserve this?

Young Clay Aiken, ridin' with the razor
They hear my shit and can't believe that I'm Caucasian
Came from the basement, never lost patience
Long hair swingin' like I played for Iron Maiden
Drink while it's rainin', smoke while I'm bathin'
Motorola ringin' and my ring bling-blingin'
Switchblade shinin', shotgun ridin'
White skin pimpin' like a young Rob Schneider
Bitch, I'm zonin', bitch, I'm dyin'
Smokin' in my grave only time I get silence
Bitch, I'm zonin', bitch, I'm dyin'
Smokin' in my grave only time I get si-lence

I ain't afraid to die
Please come and try
I ain't afraid to die
Please come and try

"Halo makes natural beauty the first time that you use it
You need no special rinsing after you use it
So Halo everybody, Halo
Halo shampoo, Halo
Halo everybody, Halo is the shampoo that glorifies your hair
So I love shampoo Halo"

Everytime I fall for you I know deep inside you'll fall for me too
Anytime you call my name, I will be right here waiting for you
Everytime I fall for you I know deep inside you'll fall for me too
Anytime you call my name, I will be right here waiting for you
I'm waiting for you, girl
Waiting for you to come home
I will be right, I will be right, I will be right here waiting, get here tonight

Everybody worried 'bout their clothes now
Ain't nobody worried 'bout their flow now
The only one out here really throwing down
Turn the song loud, but I still hear no sound
No sound, rolling 'round downtown in the all black cloud
Punk on dope, sixteen, left home
Flashback to the snow, raised on the backroads
Chains on the tires but we still gon' slide
Sun coming up but we still gon' hide
Said we gon' ride 'til the day that we die
But that day came soon 'cause we all still alive (what)

Friends turned strangers, life gets stranger
World starts changing but I gotta stay adjacent
Drink every day, smoke when it's raining
Things that we did back home in the basement
Friends turned strangers, life gets stranger
World starts changing but I gotta stay adjacent
Drink every day, smoke when it's raining
Things that we did back home in the basement

And I can't fall asleep
Without you laying here next to me
And I can't fall asleep
Without you laying here next to me

Riding in the back of the hearse it's the
Young dead boy one hand out the dirt
Lurking is for sure flicking ash on the curb
Every verse is a curse scorched marks in the earth
Wicked as could be, wicked as the sea
See the waves coming down like my high when you leave
Can't breathe, can't see, can't do a fucking thing
Can't eat, can't sleep, bitch you turn me to a freak
Drain the blood from my veins hang me outside in the breeze
Throw my body to the birds if you don’t need me
Drain the blood from my veins hang me outside in the breeze
Throw my body to the birds if you don’t need me

I’ve got something for you and baby if you let me
I could show you just what it is you’ve been missing
I’ve been sleeping by the river, waking in the hills
And I've still yet to find anything real
I’ve got something for you and baby if you let me
I could show you just what it is you’ve been missing
I’ve been sleeping by the river, waking in the hills
And I've still yet to find anything real

Rolling up dope
Pimp named Bones, switchblade in my coat
I don't need hoes, I don't need dough
Bitch, I'm flowing and going the way the rest won't go
I'm the best, y'all know, shit, wilding out
One million blunts, now I'm losing count
Riding 'round, it's just me and Boo
Bucket seats on my old school
Bass in the trunk and it's knocking and thumping
I'm taking them lanes out my Chevrolet
Jumping and snapping, I'm booming and clapping
I'm shaking the earth like everyday
Everyway, bitches say anything to get a pay
Anything to get it good, that's just just like everyday
I'm loc'ing, I'm doping, my girl dead, she hopeless
She overdose, I roll a bone, I'm zoning out while I'm smoking
The razor blade flicking, the teenage demon
The slim young punk, in the alleyway scheming
Young Charles Manson, these bitches think I'm handsome
Ain't showered in a week, still these bitches like cancer
Bitches like anthems but I don't rap for that
Take a beat and make it mine and then I let you have it back
Bones

When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out

I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out

Smoking weed to calm me down, 'cause I be the crazy lady
Don't got my straight jacket, but I got a full metal jacket if you bitches wanna feel a lot of pain
Come and test my gangsta, I'ma send you hoes to hell
And send yo mama flowers, telling her I wish her well
All black on with the mask like Jason, covering my face, I'm player hating, you snitching bitches couldn't tell
You already know how we do it up in Memphis
The rumors are true, man, I catch you bitches slipping
Call my nig, tell him that, I got ammo, grab my gat
You better not think the shit a game, mane
I ain't no killer but I will do my thang, mane
One, two, three, I'll send them killers at ya, bitch, I'm a fucking OG
And I smoke OG, K-U-S-H all in me
Got me feeling hella mellow, never met a nigga or a bitch that could stand up to my team
Snort that coke up off the table, feeling like I'm Scarface
I'll send pass with all my haters but I quickly erase
Them, they ain't on my radar no more
All of my niggas, they be trained to go
Fucking with pimping, they will cut your throat
Y'all chase the Caddies with 10's on them hoes
Mane, you hoes weak as water
And most of you sucka ass niggas be flodging
1990's gangsta shit, you don't wanna jump into the high seat with the piece again, bitch

When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out
When you see me you know
That it's some shit, 'cause I don't come out
I'll be in yo' house, I'm on the couch with the pistol out

Blown out, blown out, bitch I'm blowin' dope out
Blown out, blown out, bitch I'm fuckin' smoked out

Swang in the lane with the blade on me, motherfucker now what's the problem
Backwoods rolled with the phone on hold, tell your girlfriend please stop callin'
Problem solver, no revolver, but I go bang like a 12 gauge shotty
Scales on my body, young reptile
Creep through the night I'm the chills in your spinal
Graveyard God, Tombstone Lord
Bitch I look like violence and sound like gore
Blood on my hands, regrets on the floor
Sleep in the waves wake up on the shores

No Glock in the dashboard

Everybody wanna smoke, but don't wanna get high
Everybody wanna live, but nobody wanna die
Everybody wanna flow, but all they fuckin' do is rhyme
Everybody wanna know, how I got so fuckin' tight
No school, lotta drugs, ten grand worth of Backwoods
Bitch I got it bad, so it's hard for me to act good
Amethyst rings, rare rocks help me breathe
Inhale, blow the smoke, like a candle in the breeze
No keys, no keys, I ain't pushin' what you think
Everytime I hear your music, make it hard for me to think
No strap, no blade, still I take your life away
Never smile, always high, way higher than you think
Black granite on my sink, white marble on the counter tops
Livin' so lavish, oak doors when i fuckin' knock
Runnin up the fuckin' block, dope up in my fuckin' sock
Stop, go to fuckin' cops, but I keep bookin' and never stop

Let me breathe, I just need some time just so
So I can think, I just need some air baby
Now what you think, me and you forever that would
Be a dream, whatever you need tell me
Whatever you need tell me
I can try my best to get it for you

For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with, to be filled with, hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man

I'm in the garden with the roses
Cup full of oceans, Backwoods smoking
Rare rocks on my fingers
Feeling like a young prince back in 1346
Moats full of acid, ash on my mattress
Drawbridge up, "Thou shall not pass"
Fine art on all the walls, bitch I make and break the laws
Horse and buggy, no cars
Whole village bow down
Step up to my balcony and wave at the crowd
Cane made of emeralds, coins made of gold
Spider silk robes, let them drag on the floor
I never knew I'd be the one
Looking in the mirror at the legend I've become
I never knew I'd be the one
Looking in the mirror at the legend I've become

What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another

First I give her 100 pills, then she turn into a corpse (what?)
Blade on my waist when you see me on the stage (SESH)
Try to run up talking down, I will take your life away (what?)
Baby look me in my eyes, I could never tell a lie
I'ma always keep you safe, please just put your hands in mine (huh)

Ride with me, ride with me, I need to know
Will you die with me, die with me? Just let me know

Tell me that you really love me, I just really need to hear it (SESH)
Ride with me, ride with me, I need to know

No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No lights, no tunes
Windows closed, we just doin' what we do
Motion pictures on the screen
Backwoods gettin' blown to the breeze
They know it's Bones when I'm steppin' on the scene
Blade in my jeans, blunt guts in my tee
Creepin' through the dark, if you need to find me
Young white punk from my head to my feet
My mama know I love her but I know just what she see
A little boy gettin' high, rappin' on beats
No diploma to my name, was barely sixteen
Dropped out, left home, now these bitches on me

No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No lights, no tunes
Windows closed, we just doin' what we do
No shirt, no shoes
It's just me and my girl up in the room
No shirt, no shoes

Young Nick Lachey, grippin' on my blade
Trynna catch a fade, you know where to find me
Alleyway creep, motherfuck a week
I'm smokin' all year and I put that on me
They see just how I rap and they think I'm actin' black
But what the fuck that mean, bitch, I'm ridin' in the back
Still with my brothers, your bitch, she under covers
Tell her "Wake me up" when the Backwood burnin'
Earth stay turnin', blunt gets shorter
I just hope I'll live to show my father what I'm doin'
I just need to know if you trynna roll
Gotta let me know, any second I can go
If I die tonight, I just hope you know I love you
I just hope you know how I really feel about you
If I die tonight, I just hope you know I love you
I just hope you know how I really feel about you

You can't run, you know, you can't hide
You find it hard to sleep at night
Ghosts in the dream you afraid to fall asleep (Asleep)
Say you don't believe but you down on your knees
But you'll never get an answer (Never get an answer)
Backwoods in my lungs, pocket full of drugs

Die slow for me

Too high, she don't even breath
She pass away, and resurrect for me (SESH)
My bitch ride like a Model T

Riding in the car, not knowing where we are
Wonder where you are, when you're oh so far
Sun goes down and the nights get cold
I hope you're okay, I just wanna come back home
I can't sleep without you here
I can't breathe without you near
Lot of things I wanna say
Just know that I love you every day

Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
I could love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me

Rollin' a back, hundred bitches on my lap
In the coke white caddy, it's the young white mack
Tryna jack, turn back, razor blade on my lap
Put the steel to your cap then be ghost in a flash, like
Turn off the lights, I'm coming home
I don't wanna see you all alone
I don't like to hear your pain, girl
I just wanna feed you drugs, girl

Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me
Love you every day
Just know that you're everything to me

I'm in the bathhouse, smoking Backwoods
Ash on the stone, steam filling up the room
Fresh fruit, cold water, let me breathe
Open up my eyes, everything Japanese
Blade always with me, your bitch, she with me too
Ever since she seen me, she know I seen her too
Have her for the night, I'll see that bitch soon
Climbing out the window, while I'm putting on my jewels
Walking through the river, water in my shoes

Haku, listen. I just remembered something from a long time ago, I think it may help you. Once, when I was little, I dropped my shoe into a river. When I tried to get it back, I fell in. I thought I'd drown but the water carried me to shore. It finally came back to me. The river's name was the Kohaku river. I think that was you, and your real name is Kohaku River

Walking through the river, water in my shoes
Trying to find my way back to where I found you
Walking through the river, water in my shoes
Trying to find my way back to where I found you

Blade on my waist
Blunt to the face and I'm up in this thang
Drugs in my veins, your bitch is so lame
Remember her throat, don't remember her name
Creep in the night, hear my knife from the flip
Taking your life then I'm taking your bitch
Feeding her drugs and watching her die
Kiss on her lips then I'm shutting her eyes
If she with Bones, she ain't leaving alive
Truthfully die, she was living a lie
Hated her folks, loved all the drugs
Hated true love, she just loves to fuck
Love just to gut, love just to roll
Hated just to talk so she always moans
Riding all alone and I wish that I was home
Wishing that I didn't go down this road
The day that I die, hope my mama don't cry
Hope she realized it was just my time
Nobody ever ready to bury their own child
But I'm dead already so I'm good for awhile
Young white punk, dead girls rolling blunts
Blood on the Backwood, roll 'til she numb
Cuts on her wrists, teardrops on her face
So I flip my switchblade just to let her know she's safe
She just want Bones, I wanna be alone
I don't need friends, I don't need no home
I don't want money, I don't need a fuckin' car
Rather sleep in the alley, rather live with the bums
Young fucking scumbag, I don't know how
Bitches like me, but fuck it, it's alright
They hear how I rhyme, see how I act
They see my shows just to hear me rap
Baby, I could save you, come with me now
Take her to the grave then I put her in the ground
Hands on her neck, now she's saying: «Take my life»
Who am I to deny such a beautiful sight?

What, Bones
SESH, Yeah
Yeah, what

Oooh, please don't go (what, what)

Haunted house, haunted blunts
Blowin' ghosts when I'm dopin' up
Three knocks, open up
Spider webs cover everything
100 woods that ain't enough
She rollin' drugs till her fingers bleed
Pass her way she pass away
Flick ash and she pass a flame
Overdose and I'm the one the blame
Young Bones she know my name
All alone, all alone, close my eyes and then I'm in my zone
Dyin' slow, dyin' slow, ring the bell but ain't no one home

Haunted house, step inside
Welcome to my world
Dead girls on the floor, more in my room
Haunted house, step inside
Welcome to my life

The first time was the last time
The last time felt like the first time
I'm trying to find the place deep inside
I can be all by myself tonight
I be smoking too much, be sober too little
My mother told me stop as I'm gutting up a Swisher
The way that I be living I hope that I see my children
See them break my rules, see them doing what they shouldn't
Middle of the night, outside by myself
Breathing in the air, hoping that it ends well
Silence in my ear, too loud, can't hear
Echoes in the streets be the sound of the breeze

I miss the life that I had with you
I close my eyes, hope to see you soon

Left me outside in the rain, gettin' dark, what do I do?
Deep breaths on the stoop, Backwoods gettin' smoked
All alone with my brothers, never catch me in the clubs
Leave you all behind, I could start a-fuckin'-new
I could wake up every day and I could never think of you
I wish that you truly knew what the fuck you needed to do
Maybe shit would've worked, maybe then I thought you knew

Leave you all behind, I could start a-fuckin'-new
I could wake up every day and I could never think of you
I wish that you truly knew what the fuck you needed to do
Maybe shit would've worked, maybe then I thought you knew
Leave you all behind...

Getting any bitch open
Imagine me in yo back
With no batteries
It suck and it sad to see
But it ain't my fault its happenin'
I don't fuck with those backwoods men
Got this pack words in packaging
Wrap her up and then send her out
After I hit it I'm out of bounds
I don't give a fuck about how I sound
Compared to me you're just silent
But I'm vibrant
Like the volume
Of them sirens
Of the pigs
That you be riding with
Yeah, fame life plus SESH subtractor bitch, go!

If you really want me to
I'll keep you safe in case they come for you
It's '99, but it's feelin' like it's '92
My hair get long, way longer than my fuckin' life with you
I'm in the dark, cryin' hard, teardrops up on my fuckin' shoes
You say you happy, I say "Bitch, that's good for you"
You say you hate me, I respond with "I love you too"
It's nothin' new, with my brothers on the fuckin' stoop
Still doin' what'll end up killin' me, the funny thing is
I could never give a motherfuck if you never ever end up feelin' me
Girlfriends, they hearin' me, boyfriends, they fearin' me
Skinny white motherfucker, rollin' up another blunt
And sippin' up on my Hennessy
Said that you'd be there for me, tell me, what did I do?
Turn to ghost when the flashbacks go
I'm dying with a thought of a thought of you
You know deep down that you wish you'd never done it
Now you're all alone and I truly hope you love it, yeah
Ridin' on them thangs
Ridin' on them thangs
Ridin' on them thangs

No license no insurance calling
No contracts bitch that's real balling
Pullin up tanks TEAMSESH be the army

Uh, what, what, what

Hoppin' out the car, lookin' like a rockstar
I'm in the cut, never find me where the cops are
I'm at the house, never out where the bops are
I ain't at the bar, I ain't where them shots are

I'm in the hills, with the birds, where them flocks are
I'm at the top, still ain't down where them rocks are
Fresh fruit, and salad on my dinner plate
Aqua with the ice, and the cash like Jake The Snake
I'm on a different plane, I'm in a different lane
Penthouse suites booked under a different name
They all look alike, they all sound the same
I'm no shirt, hair swangin' in the fuckin' rain
No chain, no gold, let it fade away
Took 'em to the pawn shop, swapped 'em for some fuckin' change
I gotta eat, team gotta eat too
Tell 'em put the house on, we leavin' with the fucking loot

Hoppin' out the car, lookin' like a rockstar
I'm in the cut, never find me where the cops are
I'm at the house, never out where the bops are
I ain't at the bar, I ain't where them shots are

Blunt guts in my veins, Backwoods on my lips

Black beeper on my hip, buzzin' hard like a bitch

Nextel makin' moves, and I make a bitch strip
(What?)
Feed her drugs, watch her die, I'mma help the suicide
All my girls goin' to die when they see I have a ride
When they see just how I act, when they hear just how I rap
All black to the hat, now I'm creepin' for the cash
Flashback to the past, now I'm pimpin' in the flash
Fuck whoever said I wouldn't, gettin' cash, flickin' ash
I'm, bitch, livin' life like a prince
Got jewels on my hands, heirlooms on my wrist
I'm, what, livin' like a motherfuckin' prince
Got jewels on my hands, heirlooms on my wrist

God damn, I'm so dope like a bag of the blow
Fucked your bitch in the bathroom and you didn't even know (didn't even know)
I just hit it from the back while she sniffin' the snow
Bust a nut in her face then I hit the backdo' (damn)
I'm a crook, motherfucker, got no love for the po' (fuck you)
I can never wife a bitch, I'm in love with the dough (I'm in love with the dough)
Got some plugs on the drugs, I can get 'em for low (fuck with me)

Ride around town with that money on me
Ride around town with that money on me

She got a bad drug problem and she want me to solve it
She know I got work, in the back of the 'Rari
She say I'm charming, I say I'm not
She say she fallin', deep in love
I tried to warn her, she wouldn't listen
She eat prescriptions, now she fuckin' trippin'
She lyin' on me, she dyin' on me
I check her pulse, just to make sure that she fuckin' breathing
She a fuckin' mess, I'm a fuckin' legend
I don't deserve this shit, she don't deserve that necklace
She livin' young and reckless, I wish I never met her
2 million in the box, 25 thousand missing
She say she bought some clothes, I know she bought some blow
I see it in her eyes, I see it on her nose
Oh, Bones knows, bitch Bones knows
Don't you try and fuck around with a lost soul
#
If the good die young, I've been dead for a minute
In the cemetery buried
Come and pay your boy a visit
All these women think I'm livin'
Till they can't feel a pulse
Ski-Skittish at thought, they fell in love with a corpse
I'm a ghost
White noise when I flow
Lights flicker, wind blowin', all the windows close
See the street lights go, with power in your home
Feel the chills up your spine, just know that it's Bones
Windows95, floppy disc when I rhyme
VHS stay glitchin', flickin' ash, sippin' wine
Digital skies, smokin' digital blunts
Got a pixelated blade break you down, roll you up
Prometh swimmin' pools, codeine bath tubs
Cristal shower running, lay Hennessy in my blood
Young fuckin' pimp, pimpin' bitches on the strip
Tryna hit without a grip, you gon' be talkin' to the clip
No, I never pull triggers and I never take a life
But I will take your girlfriend out for the night
Have her back in the morning, now she really don't want you
Pack her bags, hit the road now she goin'-goin' gone

Rap Shawn Hunter, all the bitches think I'm gorgeous
They say the flow magic, I'm looking like a shaman
Young white punk, got that switchblade in my pocket
I'm looking for the prophet, the bass stay knocking
When I stay flocking, the pimp keep flowing
You saying that you out here, but Bones don't know you
I'm stepping on the scene, bitch it's me and Yung Lean
Dem Franchize Boyz - white skin, white teeth
Ice cubes in my glass of my Arizona tea
Codeine waterfalls, baptized in the pink
Marble on the floor, white granite on the counter (Counter)
Number one stunning in that baby blue Prowler (Prowler)
Backstreet boys in the alleyway, smoking
SESH be the team till the casket closes, boy

Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, gripping tight around my blade
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, gripping tight around my blade

Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, grip tight around my blade
Tears rolling down my face
In the night time creeping, grip tight around my blade

Crying blood from my eyes, crying blood from my eyes
Young tears, fucking hoes in a Bape mask disguise
Lean and Bones ripping on the kidney stones
Ray Golden playing trombone
Got yo bitch in my bed, you can still hear her moan
No one likes a bitch if she looking like Ke$ha
TeamSESH and Sad Boys, you know we do it better (Get the gold)
Get the cheddar, you bitches should have fed her
I sat through with her while she's wetter, you will find I look fresher
Pull my heart out my sleeve (Lean)
Living a fantasy dream
If you wake up being you, can I wake up being me?
If you wake up being you, can I wake up being Lean?
Young white chubby Lean look spectacular
Fuck a hospital, my doctor's called Dr. Acula
Eat her out, then I beat her down, I'm savage y'all
Call me Basquiat, 'cause I got that caviar

Tears rolling down my face
In the nighttime, make a Sad Boys logo in my face
Arizona gun in my waist
I'll be fucking with you lames till you caught up in my pace

Like that nigga is a rookie, fuck you mean?
I made the all-star team
Call me Larry Bird, shootin' niggas bout they green
Boston Celtic-lookin' nigga blowin' hella fuckin' trees
Got them niggas' girlfriends all on the fuckin' knees
When I hop out the fuckin' goddamn black Jeep
I'm a Raider on the creep, never sleep
I peep the shit around me
Before them niggas doubt me and now them bitches like me
That shit ain't right, I don't like, I will fight
If you take my family name, lose your life
And that's the game 'til I stop

Steppin' on the scene and know I'm grippin' on that fuckin' Mac
Shootin' at your fuckin' butt, I'm creepin' up through the fuckin' back
Posted on the fuckin' tack, I'll pack the straps up in my Mac
Cock it back and let it fly, victim of a homicide
Slidin' in the fuckin' ride, take you to the other side
Stuff your body in the trunk, hit the fuckin' countryside
Drop your body in a ditch, then I'm finna hit the switch
Keep that .45 for any motherfuckers tryin' to snitch
Ridin' with the fuckin' clip, murder on my fuckin' mind
Bullet packed into my gat in case they try to blow my high
Hop out, let it fly right into the fuckin' sky
Step up on your fuckin' block
My Glock, they know the fuckin' hot
#
At the top of Topanga
Looking down on you
We don't fucking know you
There's not a thing that we owe you
New blade, new metal
Blackwood on the gloss still handle 
SESH written on the sign
Welcome to the land of the rhymes
House made with our own two hands
When you see it's a whole new land
Snakes sleep in the dirt
Talk down you can sleep in a hearse
Fresh green, pink roses
Bees buzzing as I'm backwood rolling
All natural, when I'm smoking
All natural, when I'm flowing
Everything homemade
From the drank to the fruit that we eat
So close to the sun
Wake up then I bloom
Rocks underneath my feet
Mud slide when it rain
Everything that we dream
Every plan that was made
Right now all falling into place
It ain't fake cause we made it that way
Fresh lemonade smoking in the shade
Team SESH till' the end of days
Once you come to the trap
There ain't no turning back
Microphone lotta drugs in the mattress
Alcohol and some subwoofer's blastin'
I don't rap, I make magic
SESH

Color Television, Fans on the ceiling
Abstract art on the walls, living different
1989, talking on the phone
Wind blowing hard, all the windows closed
Turquoise sheets, pink pillows
Motel six that's room twenty four
Meet you in the morning, meet me here tonight
Vibrating bed, got a saying alright
Black marble sink, gold in the faucets
Fresh bar soap, mini shampoo bottles
Playing some Atari, if she blowing on my cartridge
Room service knocking, I can hear them at the door
Do not disturb, hanging on the knob
Shady part of town, but I'm floating on a cloud
Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television
White noise screens, tell her she can scream
Loud as she wants, let her know how she feels
Pearls on her ears, heels on her feet
Slipping off her dress and she sipping on a drink
I was at the bottom, I know thats how she like it
Turning off the lights and I'm turning up the Marvin

Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television
Tell her meet me at the motel six
We got drugs and a color television

Young Stamos so you know my house is full
Ten bedrooms all stuffed full of hoes

They tryna fuck with me so they can fuck me all damn day

Sesh, What, Yeah
Bass striking like Tyson in the fucking first round
I could love you like Marvin and it be his father who put you down
I could feed if you starving or I could keep you in a drought
I could show you what it takes and make these peasants bow right down
I'm a god, I'm a legend
Hear the beat and then I'm in heaven
Don't got no faith in religion
No motherfucker can tell that I'm wrong, cus' I'm right
You my own fucking mind
White skin, black lungs
Silent movie when I rhyme
Lavish soap up on my spine
I don't got no money on my mind
I'm just trying to live my life
Take a deep a breath, and now I'm fine
Beat beating like my heart
Been the same from the start
Just a young fucking punk
With some hate inside my heart
Teardrops while I'm smiling
Probably laughing while I'm dying
I be coughin' to the coffin
I be rhyming till' I'm Audi
Get back, Get back
Motherfuck real rap
Bucket hats, bucket seeds
Like a young fat pack, boy
You can't do it like me
Got a hundred and one bitches and they all like me
That's gorgeous, flawless, they fuck me while I'm flowin'
The skinny white pimp, I'm the motherfucker ownin'
The weeds and seeds and It's creepin' up on the trees
And the leaves, they be fallin'
Breaking up on the concrete
You ride for your team
Say you lying through your teeth
You could sell a million records and still never be me
Bitch aw, you praying
I look at you like you playing
You talking to the sky like you gone get an answer
Here's an answer for your question
If you trying to get a lesson
Take a seat and fucking listen
Cus' this class is now in session
I'm the best, I'm the best
I am rap in the flesh
I am flow, I am cold
I am crack, I am dope
Getting high from the sounds
My eyes low to the ground
#
Arm out the windows
Swerve to the tempo
Rims go round
Like cigars full of indo
Ride with yo kinfolk
Sun beat down
Windows up and the bass up loud
See the alpine blastin'
Petal I'm mashing
They tell me I'm the best and I know they ain't gassin'
Looking like Christ
Sippin' alizé passion
I ain't even smoke
Still the tray full of ashes
Every time I pass
Yeah i'm laughing
You're sitting at your mama's crib actin' like you rappin'
Say you gettin' famous
I say you're still nameless
You say you been trainin'
I say you been wastin'
Time of your life
You gonna die one day
And regret trynna copy every word that I say
Bitch, it's in me
Never been trendin'
Hand me down clothes
While you stuck rockin' Fendi
No brand names on my tags
I'm sportin' hand me down rags
No Glock in my wood grain dash
I kill em off like the way that I rap
Switchblade still stuffed in my pants
Let me know if you want to meet death
Ice cold flow
See the frost on the glass
Let me know if you trynna be next
Try too hard but bitch I do this
Ice cold flow
One hand
I'm cruisin'
Never pop girls
Never playin' no shoot
And vanilla paint job on my ice cream buick
Chocolate, my seats
And my trunk go bananas
Shake, earthquake
Know it's young Bones jammin'
Girls ain't dancin'
Eyes ain't gluin'
I ain't even looking but I found that chewin'
#
I'm high, I'm never low
I do what others won't
I see what others don't
I flow until I grow
I go until I crow
I roll and then I smoke
They all know that it's Bones
As soon as they see the storm
The clouds they rolling in
The tides they coming close
My mind is on a level
That's far too hard for most
I'm far too cool to boast
So me I just show
See me I just rap
See you, you just don't
You shoot, I never shot
You rhyme, I never rhyme
You die, I never die
I'mma multiply and divide
You search but me I find
You sleeping while I'm rhyming
You say that you wanna rap
You say that you wanna grind
You got no fucking time
You got no fucking cash
You full of fucking excuses
I'm full of blunt ash
Take a nap, drink a five
Leave the rapping to the Gods
In my quarters on my throne
In my castle in the sky

Jet black hair on my cold white skin
Remind you of the winter when night rolls in (x2)

I'm froze
Freezing, freezing, freezing (x3)

Freezing, freezing, freezing
I'm froze

[Outro]

Money in my sock, I got money in my sock
I got money in my sock, I got money in my sock

Money in my sock when you see me in the street (street)
No I don't got much, but I got my blade so don't test me (test me)
I'm just tryna live, don't you try to fucking stop me, I'll never hurt a soul but I will if you try me (try me)
I'm Riding, Riding, I'm Riding

Poison in my veins, everybody know my name
So everybody know my face, cuz they see me on the screen
They hear me then they scream, Bones on the creep
2am, in the middle of the night
I be smoking in the middle of the street
I got money in my sock, love in my heart
Drugs in my blunt, got a match and i'm about to spark

Money in my sock, I got money in my sock
I got money in my sock, I got money in my sock
Money in my sock, money in my sock
Money in my sock, I got money in my sock

Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened

Young motherfucker with the old ass flow
Lemme take y'all back to the nine nine four
On the lime line phone
Y'all love on hoes, finna pick up a Swisher
In a whole brand new zone
Got a brand new flow, and my old hand me downs on
On my throne, with my motherfuckin' crown on
Val Venis, nothin' but my towel on
Hair slick back, Uncle Jesse with my prowl on
Bass get to pound on, ridin' with my team
I could die tonight, so before I leave
Just know that I'm here for one reason only
Let my voice bang loud, while you Swisher rolling
I'm out, but let me roll that shit
Takin' way too long, lemme hold that shit
Got veins full of dope, skin same color as coke
But my mind pitch black, like nobody home
Home of the great young pimp named Bones
Bow to the legend, for he might be gone
Everybody act like they know what's cool
All I gotta do is hit the jukebox, and boom
Lookin' like Fonzie, feelin' like Shawn
I'm in the summer with my shirt off stuntin'
I got the whole block jumpin', it's like a criss-cross concert
Say, fuck your concert, fuck your sponsor

Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened
Somethin' bout that gold chain
Somethin' bout that white skin
Somethin' bout that pimp named Bones
Got 'em feelin' a little frightened

Blunts, I roll 'em
Sippin' tanqueray, no soda
See I'm too young to be sober
That's Team SESH till it's over
#
You don't have to call me, heh
My love will be there for you
And you don't have to worry, hey
Cuz our love will be there for you, girl (x3)

White Marvin Gaye
No Glock, no cape
Treat my blunts like bullets
Take one to the face
Outside in the rain
On the ground where they play
Trench coat
Wind blowing
Drops dripping down my face
I don't claim I bang
Feet up sipping Tang
Penthouse where I lay
I'm a god so they pray
I'm a legends what they say
Turning night into the day
Feel the bass trunk shake
Feel the fucking earthquake
Motherfuck a brand name
Wearing all my own clothes
SESH written on the tee
SESH etched in my bones
Ice Cream on the cone
Started melting then it froze
Safe to say I'm too cold
No shirt in the snow

You don't want to fuck with me , no
Got the police busting at me
But they can't do nothing to a G
#
Creepin up out the grave
Ancient silk up on my fucking bones
Pullin up with that wave
Bitch its teamsesh till i fucking go
Steppin up on the stage
Speakers blowin from the microphone
Sparking a blunt to get in my zone
Close my eyes
Feel alone
Replenishing, recovering
Drugs got me hovering
Say ya girl getting bothersome
So I call her over just to bother me
Your girl say that you tiresome
Won't fucking drink
Or get high or nothing
I go home, she come over
Says she lost so I think
That ima find her something
I'm in the coupe Deville
Smoking by my fuckin self
My top is down my feet are up
I'm banging fucking sesh
Lean with it rock with it white tee
Sharp and the Glock stay cocked
On the block one shot in them
See I don't pull triggers
See I don't twist fingers
I stuff cigars full of drugs
And I'm drinking liquor
So I lean with it rock with it
Lean with it rock with it
#
Smart-house mansion
Japanese lanterns
Bath house, bathing
When I'm feeling anxious
Gotta be patient, jumping guns dangerous
Boom goes the bass, and it's shaking the paintings
Life is a vacation, fine wine tasting
Never see me change, only re-arranging
Nothing's what I'm claiming
Something's what I'm gaining
Woke from a dream, to a sight so amazing
Studio basement, writing in the attic
Dave in the kitchen, cooking up something lavish
Money in the mattress, gold in the safe
No I never go to banks, cause I don't feel safe
No brand names, young hand me down veins
Wear my father's old watch
With my grandfather's ring
Feel like a king, but I'm looking like a prince
Cause I'm young and I'm gorgeous
The life of a pimp
Rose water tea, fresh honey from the house
Strawberries from the garden
Never shop, never buy
I ain't buying what you selling
You just lying, you a felon
And I'm a nice you fellow when the volume on eleven
Jaguar in the the driveway, the '98 model (Vroom)
Yellow Testarossa when I need the full throttle
Motherfuck a bottle, water in my chalice
Wonderland blunts, with a girl like Alice

Yeah, my feet up in my palace
Everything golden, everything lavish
Living life so lavish (lavish, lavish)(x2)
#
Hundred spoke rims
Hundred proof gin
Doing 150 in my hundred dollar timbs
Tangueray clouds
Alize drops
Cognac dreams of the motherfucking top
Diamond on the wheel Ruby on the dash
Sapphire blunts flicking emerald ash
24 karats 24 hours
Got a penthouse look like the Eiffel tower
Mary Antoinette
Jewels on my chest
Village bow to me when I'm hopping off the jet
Shag rug carpet all gold vossen the day that I go need me a gold coffin
Blunts I'm sparking pitbulls barking never catch me without some frames like Arthur
Young King Bones, heir to the throne hoes feed me grapes and hear the ring from my phone
Get the dial tonin', call and collect
Star 67 you don't get no respect
I been out there slamming doors
I been out there slamming doors knocking pictures off the wall I'm a motherfucking pimp and I'm riding in the whip
What you know about this, bitch it's 1996 I'm a motherfucking pimp
Motherfucking pimp, riding in the whip like it's '96 I'm a motherfucking pimp, riding in the whip like it's '96 what

Cold breeze warm weather
Bucket hat with my cashmere sweater
Never acting like I'm better
Still bitches know young bones never let up
Twenty five lighters on the dresser, yes sir
Lately I ain't smoke still higher, than ever
Rose water in my tea sip it slow
As I think, close my eyes, just breathe, let it go
I'm just loving every second I'm alive
From the day I was born till the night that I die
You try hard but me, I don't try
You acting like you hard but we know you just a lie
I ain't trying to portray no image
Just a young white fuck no car still driven
Young dumb funny girl looking like Patty
Hank hill whip gold wheel white caddy
Propane flowing up in my veins
Watch where you light the blunt
You don't want to see me bang, bang

You don't want to see me bang, bang (x3)

I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk


Got a new wood wheel
Gripping oak when I steer
Mahogany on the dash with some hundred spoke rims
Hit the mash and the dip
Big cigar to my lips
Middle finger out the whip yelling motherfucking bitch
Hit the bitch get the switch
Flip the trunk paint drip
Cold water let me sit just a young Slim Pimp
Ponytail in the back
Me I’m riding in the front
Two eyes to the sky one hand on the blunt
That’s 1-2-3 and to the 4
Riding around your city in that motherfucking low
The bass bang low
Trunk screaming no more
Glass break hear the sound think it’s fucking Stone Cold
I just bought me a coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in the wood wheel
Spinners on the ride I could never stay still
Red light car stop
The rims still spin

I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Trippin’ on promethazine poppin’ the trunk

Raindrops, raindrops
Commin down can't stop
Water drippin down my window
Trees shake when the wind blow
Too high I ain't lookin down
She say she too high, she never commin down
I'm just glad she came around
One milion blunts playin in the background
She say she higher that she ever been
I say that's cool, roll another one
My voice loud on the speakerbox
She tell me rewind, turn it up
My neighbour say "turn it down now
We try to sleep, it's 2AM
And we got to work tomorrow", work tomorrow
I don't give a fuck I don't work tomorrow

Makes me feel I belong to something 
We aren't human [?]

Cobblestones on the road, in the old Dutch town
Kickin' old Dutch flows
Pockets full [?] and my bones made of gold
Picking fruit up off the tree just to bring it back home
Wind let it blow
Hear the sound of the crows
Ice fall from the sky, skin same color as snow
Cops layin' low
Village scream, "Oh no!"
Kid found in his room stabbed up on the floor
Pocket watch tickin' so my mind keep racin'
Gotta get up outta town 'fore they start tracin'
Backpack through the woods, over the hills we go
Stop at Grandmama's house, young big bad wolf
All I got to my name is a knife and some change
I was ringin' through the city, all I'm hearin' is some screams, I'm..
(Fuck.)
Overthinkin' why I did it
No reason comes to mind, so I just keep breathin'
Wind pickin' up and the snow falls harder
Stick up [?], kidnap his daughters
Young bandit, wood grain hammer
Bash in your nails, tryna step to the blammer
The glitz and the glamour, from cute [?] to sin
Fuck all the bullshit, I'm throwin' up tantrums
On the run, nowhere to fuckin' hide, under the bridge with my gold and a blade by my side, I'm

Wanted dead or alive
Bag of money on my head, dollar signs on my eyes
Wanted dead or alive
Bag of money on my head, dollar signs on my eyes
What?

I'm in the projects, bitch
Bumpin' Project Bitch
See my chain tucked in
I'm never flauntin' shit
See I'm dopin' slowly
See I'm smokin', chokin'
I've been rollin', hopin'
That I live just to see my own kids
That I'm there on the day that they drivin'
That they're there on the night that I'm dyin'
No tears, tell em stop that cryin'
Lived a life full of gold and diamonds
See in my grave all i hear is silence
See in my days all i saw was violence
Gunshots when i shut my eyelids
In the A.M. wake to the sirens
It's a tragedy, when i watch the world it's just sad to me
It's like watching the death of a masterpiece
Can't do a thing just gotta watch it bleed
Just gotta watch it bleed
Can't do a thing just gotta watch it bleed
Watching the earth it's so sad to me
It's like watching the death of a masterpiece

What, SESH, Bones, yea

{Verse]

I was 13 runnin' wild in the fuckin' streets
Now I'm 19 ridin' in some bucket seats
Ramen noodles on the stove and the fridge empty
Stomach growling, water boiling, bread lookin' tempting
Take the garbage out, wrap it while I shut the can
Drag it to the curb, drop it off, spark what's in my hand
Young legend still I'm living like a peasant
All I need is a mic and you know that I could bless you
Gold doubloons on my neck spark her like the ocean
When the sun hits the liquid in the early morning
Long hair down my back like the white ranger
Young tommy, gold body, eye of the tiger
Casey Jones denim
Cold banes flannel
Fuck art, smoke blunts, do what's on your mental
Never took opinions, only took my pencil
I wrote team I wrote sesh and then they came together
Ice cream hoody with the bathing ape shoes
BBC bucket with some diamond dollar pantaloons
1932 ridin' in the model T, tommy gun up out the roof in case you tryna bother me
They all hollerin', young Bones father me
I get my belt I shut the door and teach 'em how it ought to be
Questions like they auditing, young rap oddity
They never heard a sound and seen a sight quite as hard as me


And I don't be up on no rap shit
I'm on that SESH shit, young night rat shit

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York islands
From the river forest
To the Gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Wake up in the morning yawning
Grab a towel and I hit the shower
I'm stretching, pausing, thinking
"Why only 60 minutes in a hour?"
"Why only 24 in a day?"
"Why 365 a year?"
'Cuz I know I didn't choose that shit
That shit was chose before I was here
Think it's your land all you want
Know the reason they blasting guns
If you want food then you need the funds
They don't run around banging for fucking fun
Fuck being white, I'm nothin'
You say you balling, you stuntin'
See I ain't throwing money
Bitch that's like throwing me
Only reason's we dying
You live your life inside the last
Go to school, go to work then die
Believe in a god, never wonder why
Never think about space, never think about time
My heart's beating too fast
Tryna catch my breath but I can't
Wake up as soon as I see the sun
'Cuz wasting seconds, I can
'Cuz death's around every corner
While you're worried about that mortgage
I'm smiling ear to ear
While you slipping bitch and you falling
I say motherfuck your dollars
I say motherfuck your college
I say motherfuck every year you waste
Thinking that you're gainin' that knowledge

This land ain't your land
This land ain't my land
See brother's dying
See mother's crying
From the burning forest
To the poisoined waters
This land was made for you and me

What, Bones, Bones
What, what, SESH
If you really wanna fuck with me, bring some money
If you really wanna smoke blunts, know I've got plenty
Give a fuck if you ready
Give a fuck if you're not
Young pimp named BONES, got the flow in the lot
It's like that y'all, like that y'all, s' like that, that, it's like that y'all
Now jump around, now jump around
I throw it back like Criss Cross
Sip my Cristal
Looking in my rear like really is this all?
Life that chose me, teen that hold heat
Young Jug grown a down in the street
Never around, he's sleeping
In the ground, 6 feet
BONES in the graveyard with the new white teeth (teeth)
News by lean, in the new white Beam
With my bass so loud, your radio Like wow (wow), let me slow that down
Let me show you around, like you new in town
Let me hold my ground
Let me smoke the ounce
Let me crack the Swisher, and let me gut them out
I'm rollin, rollin, Fred Durst rollin'
Fiddy cap, flip back, Fred Durst flowing
Hair like Manson, Team SESH mansion
Somewhere in the hills, flickin' ash, I'm dancing

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the  seven seas
Bones

Jet pack on my back
Laser beam on my waist
All chrome everything like its 3088
Fresh fruit up on my plate
Vintage shades on my eyes
Motherfuck your whole life
Motherfuck your 9 to 5
Flying cars in the skies
Robots in the kitchen
Space cubes in my drink
Hologram chain glistens
French doors on my rooms
Penthouse on the moon
Blowing smoke in my zone
Stardust on my shoes
Asteroids in my ring, meteorites up in my chain
I'ma fucking universe when my shit go bling
White tee
Looking like a franchise boy
But its SESH till I rest
Bringin that fuckin white noise

On the big dipper sippin mixing honey with my team
Wake up in a nebula fall asleep in a galaxy
Who's ever after me promise they won't compare to me
Money, drugs, diamonds; all that shit just ain't a thing to me
Lasers, beams, hologram rings
3088 when I'm stepping on the scene
Lasers, beams, hologram rings
It's 3088 Bones stepping up on the scene
Like
SESH
#
Night sky
Night time
Nice wine
Why you lyin' like you dyin' when you lookin' like you fine
See my white skin shinin', Bones might blind you
But take Bones' hand baby let Bones guide you
Searchin' I can find it
Examinate and [?] it
Open up her eyelids, she say it's like diamonds
Impeccable my timin'
On the private island
Used to hear violence, but now I hear violins
Granite on the counters, never had allowance
Little bit of money in my sock now I'm loungin'
Speakers stay poundin', walls stay bouncin'
Lungs stay full new day, new ounces

Overthinkin' my situation every day I'm patient
They say they stars so if so I am the constellation
Overthinkin' my situation every day I'm patient
They say they stars so if so I am the constellation
#

Key blade in my hands young Sora when I swing on destiny island
100HP and my XP full
Every level gettin' better, every day gotta flow
Pixelated pistols, a digital world
In my white noise whip with my digital girl
PS1 up in the dash dark tint up on the glass
Hydro pump in my cup, razor leaf when I ash
Bath house smoking, my white SESH robe
Toast to the team that's SESH 'till I go
You can have a clique, you can have yourself a team, but you'll never ever have a fuckin' army like me
Young sorcerer, rare stones in my chain magic leakin' through the flow like a roof full of rain
Drip drop hip hop, fuck, whatever they callin' it
But this is SESH say it right stop calling me
You stay following, me I'm only leading 'em
Album every month artwork just teasing 'em
Young legend every song be a blessing
You tryna to send a message, me I'm tryna to teach a lesson
You try too hard, me I'm goin' too hard
You say you workin' all day but only make two songs
It ain't work if you truly fuckin' love it
So I'm fuckin' when I'm flowin' beat comes and I'm bustin'


Every day is a dream
Every night be the same
I'm in my rocker on the stoop
Writing songs for y'all to sing
Every day is a dream
And every night be the same
Every day is a dream
Every night be the same
I'm in my rocker on the stoop
Writing songs for y'all to sing
#
Diamond chain, diamond frames, shining up my diamond rings
Diamond life, diamond flow, rolling up my diamond bones
On the throne, blowing O's, thinking fast, rapping slow
Hold the phone, let me go, let me snap into my zone
Let me fade, let me swing, 150 in the lane
Got the coke-white Caddy, gripping wood with the grain
Dice in the mirror, ash in the tray
Creeping, peeping in my mirror, waiting for the fuckin' day
Waking up inside the grave, smoke pouring out my veins
Headstone start cracking and the Earth start to shake
Breaking the mold when I'm breaking the flow
Snap back to reality, and now I'm just a ghost

Yeah

Thinking 'bout what my father told me (told me)

Bandana wrapped around my neck like I'm B.G
No tint on the ride, let her see me
They on the decrease, I'm on the incline
Forsberg ice, you can stay with the inline
No punchlines, I ain't got the fuckin' time
Back at lunch time, rappin' in the fuckin' line
Young legend with the flow like "fuck your life"
Nice hood, but the alleyway nothin' nice
Hand-me-down rags wrapped around my bones
In the back of the limousine, talkin' on the phone
No money, no job, no car, no house
Probably somewhere in your neighborhood, rolling up an ounce
And we keep it movin', we zoomin'
My bass loud, so we boomin'
Cup full of ice cold water
I'm living life like a movie
Now thirty blunts, that's groovy
Hundred blunts, that's nothin'
Skinny pimp, that's Bones
Got a switchblade that'll cut ya

I'm ridin' round with my brothers
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
That skinny pimp named Bones
Got a switchblade and it'll cut ya
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
That skinny pimp named Bones
Got a switchblade and it'll cut ya
#
Death up in my cup, clutchin' blunts, light 'em up
Same color blood, it's the skinny white thug
I can never give a fuck 'cause that just ain't me
I get high, so alive, now I'm P.O.D
W.P.O.D, that's White Punk On Dope
See, the only thing I've ever done in my life is flow
I'm so gone in my song, I disappear into baits
I pop up in the middle with no name, no face
Find me sittin' at my place, Netflix all day
Double Y's to the neck, can't feel my face
Hate your life so much, can't feel that pain
I can't really relate, on clean ice I skate
Sharp blades, calm wager, see Bombay
With the team, white shirt clean
They're tryin' to be me, they wanna be sick
But there's only one Bones, one skinny white pimp

I'm off a lot of drugs
I'm off a lot of drugs
I'm rolling up my blunts
I'm off a lot of drugs
#
(...the switchblade out. –that shit back. Roll up another one of those. WHAT. Look at that fucking ash-WHAT-tray though. WHAT. Sigh. It got loud. Hold on. YEAH. WHAT.)

Windows down, rolling up, whole team in the truck
Sun down, bass up, lungs full of fucking blunts
I’m gin sipping, on Tanqueray wishing
I’m throwing pennies in the fountain, mind drifting
Yeah, my mind different. Yeah, the time slipping
I tried to hold on, but my grip keep missing
One day I’m 15, next day I’m 45
In the blink of an eye, I just watched my life fly by
My seat back, recline, hair hanging out the window
Shit, soundtrack to my life, Team SESH banging bitch
Smoke pouring out the ride float, dose when we slide slow
Driving through the night, just thinking ‘bout life, like
“How long do I get before I’ve got to leave this place?”
“I got drugs in my blunt, and I ain’t 'bout to let them wait.”
I flick the light, now I’m higher
Than I ever been. She dying
She OD and she’s screaming
She too gone, she leaving

(Yeah, yeah. Bones. SESH. Yeah.)

[Hook - Eddy Baker] x2

Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me


Bitch
Smokin' dope
On my mac shit and it's not a joke
You jack me i'm cuttin' hoes
X-Man when I turn into a ghost
Squeezin' out, I do the most
All hoes jealous of my new chicks
Everything I do I abuse it
Sprite with the lean I fuse it
Niggas be sleepin' on the kid
Bones tell these guys we do this
So many girls I think I wanna 'em all cuz I can't figure out whose the cutest
BRK, Team SESH
All day, we up next
Grown man how I fuck that bitch but I've been doin' this since team sex
Underground kings and my team fresh
Pull a nigga chick with finesse
Always at heart see it through my chest
Take it to the max, I'ma do my best
She rollin' with the winners cuz she tired of you losers
What I'm sayin' is you suck and me and my team we way cooler that's why

[Hook - Eddy Baker] x2

Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me


She overdose on drugs now her eyes back in her skull
Exorcist whenever she flip she got two acid tabs on her tongue
She is Team SESH 'till I'm done
But I'm ridin' round with that klan hand me downs cover my bones I got that razor up in my hand
See I've been lurkin' up in them shadows
That silhouette in that alleyway
Hood up my head high see the moon shine sippin' Alize
Shallow Days on my stereo
Tell me what's that scenario
Fuckin' life say fuckin' stay I don't give a fuck about your area code no


Shorty wanna ride with me
Spend all of her time with me
Roll up and get high with me
Bumpin' and grind with me

Nightrat, motherfucker, I don't rap motherfucker
Flow blasts on suckers, graveyard rolling blunts, so
They all know my name, they all know my aim
Land and a mansion, living life for my team
Got my eye to the sky, clouds rolling in
Bring the storm, let it roar
When I rap, make it pour
White noise on the screen, Bones on the creep
Now you sleep in the fridge, one slash make 'em freeze
Not trying to be cool, not trying to be sick
Not trying to be dope, bitch it's just the way I is
2-006. At the crib sipping Cris', Jacob Jeweler on my wrist
Lotta stones, let it glisten
Stereo slapping, penthouse napping
Black leather couch, gold tray full of ashes
Cherry oak cabinet, drugs I'm ashing
Smoking by myself. Tryna hit it? Can't have it
Find me in the back. Alleyway rat
Torn up jeans with a razor in my pack
Long hair, flip it back. House shoes, kick it back
Fresh lemonade in my mason glass
See, imma shake patrol, imma break the dash
Cop lights in the corner of my eye, let 'em pass
Too young for bars, still ain't got no car
Motherfuck your favorite rapper tryna play the star
Throw us money up high, get that ass down low
Til' you lose all your money, and you wish you woulda know
When you young and you dumb and you rich blowin' dough
20 years down the road, now you motherfuckin' broke
Now you old and you broke, 20 years down the road
Now you wish you woulda know, now you wish you woulda know


Okay
Riding by myself. Well, really not really
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
Chandelier ceiling, pay-per-view billing
Summer Slam '98, big television

Okay
Riding by myself. Well, really not really
So heavy in the trunk, make the car pop a wheelie
#
Flawless, with my victories
You are now tuned into history
See the day that I go they'll be missin' me
See rap bang complete, I am the missing piece
Legendary everything, I touch
Masterpiece every time we fuck
In the graveyard not rolling blunts
First ash to ash and then it's dust to dust
Haunted house while I sleep inside
Dream catcher full of nightmares
That switchblade with your dreams beside
Wake up and I'm right there
That hand comin' out them shadows
One pinkie ring and it's shinin'
That car in front of your house at 4am
That's me inside it
I be
Ridin'
#
Comin' through with that flow
Hoes know that that's Bones
I'm gone off in my zone
I'm zonin' off on my dope
See Jay rollin' up more
See El roll to that store
See me I'm up in that backseat and my feet out the window
They go ham when I go
They go wherever I show
They gon' do what I want
Get me high when I feel low
See Bones creep when it's night
They leanin' off of that sprite
I'm sippin' water I'm spittin' water I'm triple H with that knife hold on
Kickin' raps and you spittin' facts that's written trash knock 'em off the map
Off the shelf put 'em in a box last nail in the coffin
Drop, parking lot, dark or not, find me where the darkness stop
Steppin' up on the block with that switchblade in my fuckin' sock

I know that shit will never change no
Automatic guns hangin' out the window
#
Don't get too comfortable, the money's for motherfuckers finna punish you
Come for you, for the darkest shit, dumber than dumb when the substance lit
Little bit nice when the dank was in 'em, the little tie dyes are my favorite visions
30 ghetto boys and the gangster isms, cos if I didn't have rap I was straightening women
From the 40 farm with the black cap back, runnin' out the whip cos the slap crash fast
Got a mask and a vest and a massive aggression, I'm packin' a pistol it's natural selection
You packin' the bowl and you pass to the next one, cold in the soul so practice affection but fuck it, let's get it tragic in Texas
Hydrocodones on my face itches scratchin' till I go faceless
This basement's where we get wasted and make these tapes so nonsensical
Walk into school, follow the laws of the mystic rule, pickin' they pockets and lickin' a shot
Cos you missing the point if you think that my mission is profit

What
Bad motherfucker and my attitude match that, get cashed and I see those flashbacks
All black with the motherfuckin' ratt pack, big blunt full of dope I ash that
I'm in the grave six feet deep, got a big screen no HD, I flick ash and watch TV, N64 no PS3
MAC D.L.E on my speaker box, call the cops my speakers not
White thug never gave a fuck, gettin' rich quick tell me why we should stop
My razor blade in my right hand, brass knuckles up in my left
Not acting hard just being Bones, just rolling drugs on my step
Yeah

Cup full of that life
Swisher full of that death
Skull full of them dollar signs, it's safe to say that I'm cashed
Eric up in the back
Sik ridin' that shotgun
Bones grippin' that woodgrain
Even red lights couldn't stop Yung
I'm gone
#
Ancient silk, gold buttons
Hear the bass, know BONES coming
Young Pharaoh, I'm a young prince
They bow to me and keep drugs coming
Rolling up on my throne
Crown flooded in stones
Sapphires, got emeralds
I got diamonds next to my pearls
Young majesty, they asking me
What I want to eat
Say "Fashion me"
Bowl of fruit, big glass of life
One satin rag to shine up my knife
All my life, every night
Eyes out the glass, case the reaper tries
Guns blaring, future died
Is it life or death, quick you decide
In the casket deep, young tragedy

Dapper punk
Flow masterpiece
Whole village
They bow to me
Turn water to lean
Turn grass to weed
#
My mama raised me well
My daddy raised me well
My brother keep me fed, keep a roof over my head
That bass up in your trunk, them drugs up in your blunt
That song stuck in your head, bitch I'm that smoke inside of your lungs
I'm coming through with that new sound, put you on to that SESH shit
You pick a trend, you hop on it, then hop off to that next shit
Motherfuck' your life, don't mention me
I don't want your name in my mention feed
You can try your best, still ain't affecting me
See I spark a blunt and play Tekken 3
Playstation, play making
Flip a brick, then I Harlem shake it
Riding scrapers, born in Oakland
Making money like I'm out in Vegas
Hit the slide, coward watch
Same one that B.G. got
On the front cover of that Chopper City
Rolex rocking like slingshots
Raise a chopper like beam shots
No evidence, no trace
My chain shine like night
Like hit the glue on that grey
See I'm kissin' roses, if you didn't notice
Getting cash while I'm staying focused
Ginger ale in my glass and you know that Glock on the dash stay loaded

Kicking typical raps, banging beats, flicking ash
Get back, get back, you don't know me like that
Kicking typical raps, banging beats, flicking ash
It's the young night rat, getting money, getting cash

Everybody wanna sound like me
Everybody wanna act like me
Everybody wanna look like me
Everybody wanna rap like me

[Outro] x2
Uh, stop it, you can't do it
Now stand back and let me do it
Bitch you can keep that 'Rari
I'd rather whip around in that Buick
#
See all the females love me, so all the boyfriends hate me
She'd rather be with Bones, but you take her ass on dates
She keep calling my phone, she hate that she gotta wait
For you to go back home, and then Team Sesh she play
My voice bang through her speakers, she close her eyes, she see me
My pictures up on her wall, she look at me till she sleeping
She see me when she dreaming, she think of me when she reading
She think of me when she buying a new ounce from her dealer
There's something bout that gold chain, something bout that white skin
Something bout that pimp named Bones that got her feeling a lil frightened
But I bet you that she like it, my ring shining like lightning
My trunk banging like thunder, light my blunt and then I'm reclining

Bitch I'm cute, I know I'm sexy
I got the looks that drive the girls wild
I got the moves, that really move em
I send chills up and down their spines
I'm just a sexy boy, I'm not your boy toy

My brother Drew up in the front my cousin Jube up in the back
Plenches with this mac, brush the clip and the rat attack
Boom, clearin' the room, prayin' for gold up on my tomb
Pullin' that thing and it's doom, all black like the fuckin' groom
Camo forces, 90's porsches, hammered voices, while I'm readin' sources, lookin' for the chewin'
Breakin' in the freak show
Put that on my ego
Trap house full of freak hoes
Pimp named Matt Hilfiger on my back
Lookin' at my cartiers with my gold stack
Lookin' for that compressor, gotta keep that varetta
These rats be after my cheddar
That bitch I really don't stress her
Hail in the sill drop you on the mac
Kickin' the dope with that cane mask and a barbed wire bat

Kreepin In the kut,In the kut,In the fucking kut (X6)

Say you sound like me thats far from truth
If you only knew that I've been it dude

Bumpin' in the Lac
Rollin' in the back
Gotta brick fulla' dope and that pack for tha rats
Gotta black Mac-10 and it boom like bap
Tanquray showers, Alize baths
Five bedrooms and they all be the same
Walls made of gold, Waterbed fulla lean

Marble floor, blunt connoisseurs
Champagne I got bottles full
Livin' life like a fuckin' prince
It ain't about me then they kiss the gold 
Murals on my ceiling (ceiling)
Pearls on my necklace (necklace)
Bitches' feeding me grapes I guess it's fresh fruit for breakfast [x2]

People look at you today 20 years later and they still have no idea what you're about
Tell me in a sentence who you are
Nobody
I'm nobody
I'm a tramp, a bum mobile
I'm a boxcar and a jug of wine

I got long hair like the Hanson brothers
But when I flip the switch, Charles Manson coming
That Marilyn Manson bumping
The swisher sweet and I'm gutting
That TeamSESH get to thumping
The whole block get to jumping
Now my gums are numb
Too crack for yall
BONES lurking in the night
Back, backing drugs
Never backing slugs
Only packing blades
I'm never lacking brains
Lay you on you back, and you pray
I don't represent no state
I don't represent no city
I don't represent no area code
Fuck where you living
These girls say that I'm different
So these boys wanna fight
Better lock up your wife
Keep your daughter in your sight

It's the tribe with the high
It's the gang with the flames
It's the punks with the blunts
It's the motherfucking team
Glass in the street
Rats in the hall
Need at least 7 digits
If you tryna get a call

Bitch like Lara Croft
Tomb Raider Glocks
Pull up to the spot
Catching waves in the yacht
Bowling on top
Tennis on the bottom
Butlers bringing champagne
Me, I'm doing nada
You can keep the Louis
You can keep the Prada
Rather ride hand me downs
Whipping in Impalas
Dreaming bout Paris
Thinking bout my father
Better charge the camera
If you tryna catch the come up
Cash, money, change
Same one as Turk
Back in '98
Young thuggin' in the dirt
I'm putting in the hurt
She lifting up her skirt
She shining up my change
Then she taking off my shirt

It's the tribe with the high
It's the gang with the flames
It's the punks with the blunts
It's the motherfucking team
Glass in the street
Rats in the hall
Need at least 7 digits
If you tryna get a call, bitch

Causing commotion when the booty in motion

Tank top, no bra, titties out
Ratchet, grab me the finest the south
Don't come around my way, better take another route
I ain't playin' witcha now
Got the one and only style that competed with me now
Cause they jealous I'm posted, I'm chillin', just watching Goodfellas

Fuck swag, my shirt got a stain and I still get hoes

Let it breathe, Let it breathe
Let it breathe, Let it breathe
Let it breathe, Let it breathe

Stone cold I'm stuntin'
Top rope I'm jumpin'

So I promise that you don't want it
I'm in the backseat of that Hummer
I'm ridin' round with my brothers
Got chopper city up in the deck
Flickin' ash like its nothin'
It's 1 million hoes every time I flip my phone
Rollin' 1 million bones just to get me back up in my zone

Young Val Venis my towel long

I was fifteen going on sixteen
My only dream to be out of that city
We drank tanqueray, we drink alizé
The snow fell down, we play shallow days
Flash back to those memories
Flickin ash on that fendi
Sending drinks to my enemies
Crackin smiles for all those that envy
I got 24s, poking out
At the club I'm showing out
Still tippin, im still sippin
Its 2AM, they still trippin

(Hook:)
Kids in the slums, shining up they guns
Get home safe, know you still you're mommas son
Don't lose that life, you'll never get it back
Don't choose that life, wind up on the wrong track

Verse 2:

My mother staying up late night
Her fingers crossed that I'm safe
I'm acting dumb, my phone's off
Last time we talked i screamed
See all i can do is hope
My kids are nothing like me
I put my parents through hell and back
And still somehow they love me
I know some people don't get that
Somebody gonna hit that
Cigars stuffed to the rim with drugs
Looking out the cut like who is that
Pulling up in that all black
Hearse so you know it's me
It's that young skinny pimp, flows something like breeze

(Hook:)

Kids in the slums, shining up they guns
Get home safe, know you still you're mommas son
Don't lose that life, you'll never get it back
Don't choose that life, wind up on the wrong track

That Bones playin, I'm fuckin' sayin'  I'm layin' low
Key for the moment, I ain't no shit
I ain't see no gunshots, i ain't load no clip
In the night, creepin', peepin' out my blinds
Will I live to see another sunrise, or will I die
I don't know
#

Riding, I smoke til I feel like dying
I smoke til I feel like flying
I'm trying hard not to lie
But these blunts only get me meaner
And these drugs only get me higher
I'm with a girl that look like a leaner
And she loading up that fire
And I'm gripping on that iron
Wanna bet that you won't try, me
While she here at least
Gimme fifty feet
I got thrift shop on my Bones
There's no place like home
You throw money in the club
See I save it up in my room
You acting like you the bomb
But I'm the only one that go boom
See I been the same since the womb
And I'ma remain till the tomb
These dollar signs in my eyes
But you know that I'm fucking cash
One million roaches in the train with the ash


Smoking in the night
Thinking 'bout my life
My hand on my lighter
Other hand upon my knife
It's cold in the streets
It's cold in the streets
It's hot up on the block if they call the police, like
Click-clack bang-bang get down low
I hate the fucking world on the fucking down low
Click-clack bang-bang get down low
The clouds rolling in I'ma make it downpour


It's raining, it's raining
It's coming down, and it's raining, it's raining
It's coming down, bitch it's raining, it's raining
It's coming down, and it's raining, it's raining
It's coming down

You know who it is bruh
Yeah, Bones
The Kid, Gxldslvgs, Team Sesh, Greywave, we in this bitch bruh
Huh

Glock in my draws as I walk the motherfucking track
All about this Ghetty Green, Crook By Da Book, young Project Pat
Evil inside, so nigga don't tempt me
My nigga The Kid, they shot with the semi
I'm sniffing that white and I call it that Whitney
I ride with the gauge like I'm Tommy Buscetta
Fuck what you claim, goon and a killer, I'm one and the same
Love negativity live for the pain
And I'm sending these hollow tips straight through your brain
I'm riding in some shit you ain't never seen
Inside, rigor mortis, outside, gangrene
Bitch

Riding through in the low (Low)
White pimp named Bones (Bones)
Long hair tied back switchblade stay stuck to my palm (Palm)
Firearm that ain't mine (Mine)
Gold slugs with that nine (Nine)
Not saying that I'll take your life so please don't take mine (No)
World way too cold (Cold)
No you'll never understand me (No)
All you see is some white kid who thinks he good at rapping
Anthrax in my backpack, loud wrap in this plane (Plane)
I'm dumb high, I'm not tryna brag
I'm just telling you what I'm seeing
I spend my days six feet deep, underground never see me
I'm the B.G., you're the Bee Gees
I'm on the come up, you on the decrease
My elevation, my progress, everything that you dream
Mansion made of big blunt wraps with a sapphire TV
Waterfall spit Alizé, bass banging like Shallow Days
Looking for a way to make a bank
Now I'm pretty sure I've found a way
Young white and I'm handsome, [?] young Hanson
Fuck with me Bones I'm Manson
Bitch that's Charles mixed with Marilyn

What
#

Just a bad motherfucker with a chip on his shoulder
Slow-mo like holder
Lemme bring that back lemme boom that bat that's a playstation controller
I got GTA on my screen
She sees me when she dreams
I'm livin' what I used to dream about when I lived at home at 13
I'm smokin' out of my window
Backroads we hit low
Flashbacks to the days on the bus playin' Nintendo
That's hide n' seek, don't you peak
Million blunts I'll be gone in a week
Sleep in the grave, live in the yard
Pimp named Bones comin' down real hard


Cadillac cars on black tints
Tape in the deck playin' Tall white tee brand new shoes
Cigar full of drugs put me in a good mood
Good mood, put me in a good mood
Cigar full of drugs put me in a good mood
#

Body in the trunk so there's no turning around


Too many people dyin'
Too many people livin'
Too many lives we takin'
Too many lives get ruined
Ridin' round in my Buick
It's nighttime we cruisin'
That slim pimp named Bones
But I bet you that you knew that
I'ma do this for my mom
I'ma do this for my father
I'ma do this for my brother
Let the beat go and now I'm water
I disappear on the beat
Look in the mirror you'll see
Sayin' my name like three times I reappear and you bleed
That's TeamSESH 'till I leave


Ridin' in the range
These bitches go insane
They see that it's Bones so they all scream my name
It's 1998 and we just ridin' to the melody
Swishers to the breeze, that's the TeamSESH mentality
#
There's a light on my pipe
Creepin' through the night
Writing lyrics spittin' verses
Then take off on the flight
I don't worry about the hype do what I think is right
Used to sip on the lean now I just drink the Sprite
I'm so out of sight like really out my mind
Searchin' for a somethin' in my life I don't know what I'ma find
Through the grape vine heard that it takes some time
But one day through the darkness a bright light will shine
So I shun all my fears forget about the hate
Never bite the hand that feeds me and any others on my plate
Most peoples first mistake is putting trust into the fakes
They offer you some cake and it's hard not to take
Automatically upset now you wanna be in debt
Sell your soul for that paper stressed out until your dead
Boy you live your life free never settlin' for less
If I blast this for a reason they gon' lay my soul to rest

Darker magician I'm sippin'
The spell I've written is sicker than a homicidal conviction
It's like a head on collision
I keep my head up on a swivel
My death up on my mental
Some drugs up in that swisher
If your bitch is tryna get in it
She keep lightin' up them candles I'm rollin' up more drugs
She keep callin' me phantom she touch me I turn to dust
Fuck with me go ghost razor blade in my coat teenager a little teen anger
And a flow that's somethin' like coke
Acid tabs on her tongue she close eyes she feel numb
She feel it once she feel at home she yellin' SESH she screamin' Bones
Look at your boy tryna act all hard see if he run for fuckin' cover when he
See the fuckin' god
Thunder bolts up in the car young Zeus goin' hard
Never had a fuckin' kid teamSESH 'till its dark yuh
#
Riding in the limousine watching rocket power
Time moving slow, a million blunts a hundred hours
All the windows down rolling wraps full of flowers
I light the match, I light the end
Smoke it like my Prowler
Murals on the wall
Stained glass ceilings
Marble floor walking
Making money for my children
Statues made of me, in the living room
Water fountains full of syrup
Spitting neck full of jewels

[Hook] 4x
I'm getting high
I'm laying low
I'm rolling up my blunts

I'm getting high
I'm laying low
I'm Kreepin in the Kut

Slidin' in my cutlass slammin the bump up on the speaker box
Prayin' to yoself I can't relate bitch I don't need a god
Find me where the demons are, ridin' in the demon car
Stone stick shift, know it's bones when you see the car
Killin' it better believe it tho
Murder right up in yo stereo
Tell me now what's a scenario
Two swishers rolled now here we go
Yo girlfriend she called you and she told you that she home
She hang up, the shots in mouth, now she ridin' round she with bones
Now she posted up in my home
Whole room smellin' like smoke
She in my bed with my chain on and when she go to sleep I'm ghost

She naked under that shirt of mine so please don't confuse it
I ain't lyin' I do it

One million blunts rolled up for the drive, it's the slim white pimp dollar signs on my eyes

Girls wanna fuck so these boys act tough
Got a pump in the trunk if you trying to press your luck
If you looking for the high, bitch you know I got the drugs
If you looking for connections you looking at the plug
All black clothing, locked and I'm loaded
Black 12 gauge, Columbine when I'm boomin'
Trench Coat Mafia, poppin' but never stoppin' 'em
Robbin' and mobbin' hard see there's just no toppin' 'em
You go hard but fuck it I go harder
Trying to run up slick and quick I'ma rob ya
Skin like powder, bass getting louder
Looking for a legend you can bet that you found him
I'm in the graveyard, I'm drinking champagne
I'm ashin' hella blunts, diggin' up hella graves
Troubled young man, murder on his mind
Pipebomb in his backpack, end your fucking life like BOOM

Grey poupon back of the limo, heading to the bath house feel like jahiro
I dont wanna dance with you girl but I watch though
Let my seat back sign a lease for the condo
One up in the midwest one up on an island one in california the sounds of the sirens
Some are playing violins but my brain frys and chocolate milkshake dollar signs on my eyelids
Big blunts on the tray with my chains, jewels layed out like its mtv-
Cribs , cris in the fridge, ice in my glass ice cold when i sip
Strawberry dipped in chocolate alpine blast through my trunk be knockin, lowkey lookin for the profit, thats nothing

Welcome to the SESH Lounge
Give it up for your first act, Bones


I need it bad like a sickness with no remedy
I'm lookin' rich so they actin' like a friend of me
I ask once and they say there's no offending me
Tell 'em keep the two cents cuz they ain't gettin' shit from me
Around the globe twice with the sings of flow
Deltron 3030 blast in my home
New ones on the stove no milk in the fridge, gotta get this money and I gotta get it quick
I'm so much better, cold in any weather
30 below zero no shirt no sweater
Onto the shit they'll be on in 10 years
5 beats 5 mics 10 murders 10 tears
I drop one whenever they pop guns
Hoods already shot no need for shotguns


Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim
Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim
Trey full of blunts, glass full of gin, pool full of Alize if you tryna swim

Young Shawn Hunter
Girl lookin' like Topanga
Mortal Kombat pop into the SEGA
Reptile bangin' Shao Kahn playin'
Lord of the underworld bass like rain
Drop like chains underground hear the sound
In the street in the night keep ya head to the ground
Bad man come with the guns and they'll get you
Cops get called and now a Glock's to ya temple
Gold bath shinin' couldn't care less
When i hear those sirens i couldn't fear less
No i don't do shit but they see that blunt
Just a young white punk hood up in the cut
Bootleg Rolex trench coat slangin'
Sidewalk talkin' my mind keeps sayin'
Gotta get the money gotta keep shit movin'
But when I'm in my casket I dont need moola
Don't need bread when I'm dead that's nothin'
Bones in the coffin blunts up sparkin'
100 gold chains now I'm young Liberace
Hand me down clothes motherfuck your Versace
Don't need bread when I'm dead that's nothin'
Bones in the coffin blunts up sparkin'

I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip
I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent

Don't make me flip it, boy you trippin'
If you think that I won't flick it
When it comes down to it I'm a nice guy but in the nighttime, I'm wicked
See, when the night falls I'm creepin'
I do it like every weekend
We get high 'til we almost die and do it again next evening
I'm just a skeleton in clothing
I'm just a crypt keeper that's flowing
Got no face, got no name, got no style, I'm nothing
That monster live in yo' closet
That drug money in yo' pocket
That devil up on yo' shoulder saying run up in the spot and pop it

I'm smokin' by myself, I'm in the alleyway and I'm bent
See, I'm high off of two blunts
And I'm sippin' on that Cris'
See, I used to be Th@ Kid, now I'm just that pimp
I got tataracs on my back and a switchblade stay stuck to my hip

Slightly down south
Swangin' on them curbs
It's like we downtown when i'm bangin' in the curse

Trippin'

But it's gettin' late there's no time to waste let's get naked
All by ourselves and we really high so tell me why the fuck are we waitin'

Alley way lurking
Skinny white fuck with the lights so perfect
Wake up then I'm working
Living fucking legend so these females smirking
Back of the limo
Tears on the pillow
She'd rather be with bones blowing O's playing Nintendo
She blowing on the cartridge
Me I'm rolling bones up
Ashtray grave yard, howl till the moon's up
Japanese animation on my laptop
[?] castle on the screen give a fuck what
You gotta say, motherfuck your diamond chains
Fools gold on my neck till that bitch turn green
See the breeze, trees, feeling leaves on your feet
Day time turns night, strong winds get weak
Storm dies down, so high right now
Marvin Gaye playing loud in the cold background
#
Bitch we all stars in the dope show
Teenage demon, black clothes, and some gold ropes
You say you go, but you don't flow
They think they know, but they don't know
Flowing too heavy
Bout to overflow
I don't do drugs
I just over dose
Graveyard god
Marble head stone
[?] young white pimp gone too soon
I swear I'm too smooth (smooth)
All my life Gold cuff link With the alligator shoes
One, two, bones coming for you
Fresh off of three four blunts I'm up on your stoop
Knock knock open up, but they won't let me in
So I huff and I puff blow that motherfucker in
Posted outside of the inn makin ends fuckin meet
Leave you down on your knees face down in the street
Snap back to reality
I'm gone with the breeze

All my life I've been better than all these rappers
Matter of fact I ain't rapping
Just a corpse inside a casket (bones)
All my life I've been way better than these rappers
Matter of fact I ain't a rapper just a corpse inside a casket (bones)
Don't wake me up

Bones in the casket
Don't wake him up

Sesh, Bones

See I don't like a bitch if she looking like Ke$ha

In the winter they fall back and act cold like December
Cup of syrup for dinner
Motherfuck that chicken
They try to get me to sign
I'm saying fuck that business, cause I don't like it
No I don't
Ridin' 'round in that low
Low sitting low on 24's
Rims poking out like whoa
I'm stepping out on the scene
It's feeling like it's 9-3
It's sounding like it's 9-6
But the bitch is from the 90's
See I'm rapping fast but I'm smoking slow
Shredded jeans, young Casey Jones
Owen Hart when I'm coming down
Randy Johnson when I'm getting (Whoa)

What you know about it?
What you know about it?
Yeah, what you know about it?
I'm riding in the Caddy with the chrome on the body

You already know, you already

I inhale what I got rolled up now life's like a kaleidoscope
Never see me change, I always been the same
They picked up the trends, I just picked up the game
I picked up a flow, I picked up a chain
I put down the game every rap that I made
See I'm goin', bitch, just like that
Roll in the back of the turbo 'Vette
Got a turbo tech with a turbojet
Click clack, boom boom, make a turbo mess
Tears drippin' down your face like it's rainin' out
You lookin' scared cause the Team and the RVIDXRS out

I dropped out and I'm finally fuckin' famous, I'm famous
See all these females they fakin', see all these cameras they flashin' so now they think that I'm jaded

Do you wanna vibe with a nigga Do you wanna ride with a real-ass nigga?
Let's chill
Do you wanna vibe with a nigga 
When I first made eye contact with the bitch, she
Was so fine, she was very fit, he
Was a nigga named Lofty305 that came up
Came down from the sky
And I say what, what I rely on is my thoughts
And my intuition, so girl
Why can't I put some pimpin' and change your whole world?
Get these dividends, make it flip, and make it come back hard
Girl, Lofty305 make you come way stronger than
Any other man, and I can and I will seal the deal
So, I just wanna chill

For this love, give death to the haters

That's what I wanna do
Just me and you
Let's chill
And let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and me and...​

Alize waterfalls, Tanqueray raindrops
Raining while it's pouring, overflowing but I can't stop
Got money, got cars, got eight spots
She tell me "Save the game", GTA save spot
'Cause she know it's Bones, she know I'm ridin' chrome
She know I'm never lone, always with my fuckin' bro
Mister 305 and Th@ Kid came in with the durags, left with your bitch
Red velvet loveseat, fireplace goin'
Rotating bed, silk sheets when I'm flowin'
Vinyls on the floor, lava lamp light the room up
Drugs from Columbia, cigars straight from Cuba
She say she heard a rumor
He cool, but yeah I'm cooler
My necklace in the freezer, my ring is in the cooler, see
Whatever you wanna do, just know I'm down
We don't gotta say a word, just let the bass pound like

Let's chill
And let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you
Let's chill
And let's settle down
That's what I wanna do

Ash out the window, roll another one
Loving the fact that I'm dumb and I'm young
I got so much time to learn

To the day that I'm gone and gone and gone and away

Arm hanging out the window, what the fuck you going through?
All I do is drugs, all I do is what you won't do
Everything your parents told you "Don't", that's what I'm gon' do
Bitch, I'm eighteen, I'm in the backseat
Blunts to face, ashes to the fuckin' breeze
Bitch look at me, I'm the fuckin' man
Dropped out, left school, left Michigan
They say it won't work, but, bitch, I'm workin'
Doin' drugs, speakin' flows and it's all worth it
Cuban links, drip, drippin' down my silk shirts
I'm on the corner with the work like Young Turk
I'm not tryin' to murder, I'm not tryin' to hurt you
Won't take your car and your kids and knock you off the Earth
Won't put you in the dirt, won't put you in a hearse
I'll put you in that yellow 'rari if you tryin' to work
I'm coming up like Tony back in the '80s
Montages of banks and the tigers and the ladies
We ridin', we never hidin', we posted, it's like eighty
Outside, really high and we rhymin' to the bass, see
You'll never find a flow like this
I'm not saying I'm the best, but they sure ain't like this
See they sure ain't like Kid, and Kid sure ain't like them
See they got nothin' on Bones, nothin' on that skinny white pimp
Bitch

Yeah
Nature, nature, nature
Burn it up in the spot
Fuck the cops

It's the spic of the year
Got hoes in my ear
Telling me they wanna hold me down, gimme years
No simp in my bones
No slack in my mack
Rather lose or get before I pay with a stack
No stars in the cut, drove cars over ice
Froze broads lemme fuck they fans overnight
Plans oversight
You old mans wanna fight
Stands got a hype, my hands hold a pipe
I'm thunder flow tundra
Got them razor raps for them hundreds
And she lay me back with that dumb head
Went to beauty school
But she flunked it
Now she calling me shaq when I dunk it
Got the stealing toe for them suckers
Like Shazaam I wish they won't duck us
But when money talk It Chris Tucker
Im seen with the green
High wit a hoe
Blue dream blowin fiend
Yall fiends for my style
Out with ya gout
Leader on my nuts
Hardy boys frown
Bacardi pourin down
Never had a name now they wait for my appearance

What?
Drugs, drugs drugs
All I do is fucking drugs
Fuck, fuck, fuck
I could never give a fuck
Ok my top back and I'm leanin'
I got two twelves and they screamin'
They telling me that my flow is dope
That's why all these bitches be fiending
Cause they need it
Cause they cheatin'
Boy run up quick and start bleeding
They get beatin'
Better believe it
See I pull up quick to retrieve it
She got back, hop in the lac
Right after that I'mma delete her
Turn her phone off get her freak on
I call that bitch misdemeanor
I don't ride around with no nina
I don't ride around in no beamer
See she pass out and she dream of me
Now I'm calling that bitch Celina
I got 30 up in my clip
I put like 30 up in that bitch
See I got money up in my pocket
Better believe you can catch a hit
Catch a lit
Got that cliché
Rap on replay
Everything they hate
About the world with a delay
Drowned in the reverb
Getting what I deserve
Lotta long nights
Fuck second chase dreams first
I can wait, oh baby no I can wait
No name, no face
No license on the fucking plate
I'm gone

Baby blue velour suits whenever I slide through
It's 2002 riding in the Lex coupe
Young jagged ash coming down parachutes
Where the party at?
Do-rag, orange suits
30-inch rims when I pull up expeditious
Bought a gold steering wheel
It's just what I was missing
Ultraviolet lights makes the whole night glisten
When you spittin' those writtens
It sounds like nothin that I'm in to
And she say the fuckin same
She say my fucking name
We ain't lovin we ain't fuckin
We just starting up a flame
Cigars full of drugs crystal champagne
Ace's on my feet AI when I play
Silk by my bones
Hoes leave me 'lone
Call the fuckin phone and they get the dial tone
I'm gettin my shine on
I'm turning your shit off
I'm turning your life down
I'm turning my shit up
When I'm riding down the street, GTA 3
White skin, black pump
Pop pop, let em bleed
Big pinky ring and it sing bling bling
My wrist chime in while my chain shine in

Look
This uh, d0-rag underneath the headband type shit
That Foo Boo velour
Yeah, all white forces ride around
Got the 112 CD in
Peaches and cream
Ride, sesh
Hmm, that's nice
That is nice
#
Doped up, take drugs and I'm posting up
On the stoop just rolling up
Too many blunts, she say "Hold up"
Just ridin' 'round
Rining out, so we slidin' round
Bass banging like thunderstorms
Talk down, see me pulling that lighting out
Then I'll strike ya, like striker
See, I roll your ashes and light ya
Either I'm with the team or I'm with the KLVN
Either way, I ain't about to fight ya
We're gonna find ya, and teach ya
That everything ain't peaches
See, everything ain't gravy
You get no handshake when I see you, bitch

Getting cash, flowing fast
Loading up my golden gat
Golden 'Lac, diamond wheel
Go so slow I'm riding still
Living life so lavish, I'm living life so lavish
I got blunt guts in the basement, I got blunt wraps in the attic
Getting cash, flowing fast
Loading up my golden gat
Golden 'Lac, diamond wheel
Go so slow I'm riding still
Living life so lavish, I'm living life so lavish
I got blunt guts in the basement, I got blunt wraps in the attic

I'm lurking, I'm swerving
I roll blunts tighter than turbans
A little turbulence on the .36
Going 96, that's murder
See, 187 my rhyme scheme
Rolex on my time piece
Cuban links on my fucking neck
I made that off of rhyming things
And now I'm rhyming still, rhyming still
Go so slow that I'm riding still
#
Just drown in the bass
Just a teenage boy with some drugs in his veins
Mask on his face, got a nine on his waist
Somewhere along the line, young man went crazy
Rain drops falling, best friends calling
Voicemail full, delete it, I never bother
Love for my father, care for my mother
Still sometimes I feel like I'm fucking going under

I'm dead, I'm Bones
See, black cover my tomb
See, this graveyard's where I call home
So that casket is my room
VHS and it's glitchin'
Cough suppressants I'm sippin'
Got cobwebs on my comforters, I got holes on all of my linens
Pocket watch in my britches, got no time for these bitches
Only got time to be living, but I'm dead so just forget it, yeah

Bitch, drown
Just drown in the bass
Just drown in the bass
Bitch, drown
Just drown in the bass
Just drown in the bass
Bitch, drown
Bitch, drown in the bass
Let her drown in the bass
Bitch, drown
Let 'em drown in the bass

We riding 'round and we swervin'
When they see the team, they get nervous
We riding 'round and we serving, bitch
We pulling guns for no purpose

What? Yeah
SESH, SESH
Jayyeah
#
Yo, this that top back, reclining
Riding 'round just shining, shit
White skin, black diamonds
When I'm sliding 'round, my chain blind a bitch
White seats with the black trim
White tee with the black Timbs
That white kid with the black kids
That bass striking like lightning
My flow is something like roll
People sell me they soul
I'm hitting curbs while I hit the swerve
While yo girlfriend hitting my phone
Got a big screen in the dash, got a 12 gauge in the trunk
When I pop that bitch, you can watch a flick or you can get hit with that pump, yeah

Coming down throwed in the Lone Star State
With Th@ Kid pouring up and the Swisher looking green
Coming down throwed in the Lone Star State
With Th@ Kid pouring up and I do it for my state, aye

Syrup got me thirsty and it's like 3:30
In the morning banging Screw, banging Screw up, know I'm saying?
OG sipper, candy dripper, need a codeine sticker
Texas made me, when I'm thirsty I be sipping liquor
Posted up with my boy Elmo Kennedy
SESH is going, Th@ Kid, that kid on that Hennessy
1MillionBlunts, got a bitch up to the ceiling
1MillionBlunts 'cause I'm one in a million, player

You see me sipping, see me pimping, see me fucking flowing
You see me flipping, see me dipping, see me fucking going
You see me sipping, see me pimping, see me fucking flowing
You see me flipping, see me dipping, see me fucking going

Johnny Cage, black shades
Call me Stryker when I spray
Yung Baraka with the blade, Reptile with the fangs
Sub-zero with my ice, Nightwolf in the night
Ermac when I fight, from the forest, taking life
Shao Khan, out the game, Liu Kang with the kick
Flow, no name, no body, no face
Just drugs, just bass, just rap, just face
I'm the lord of the underworld with the gold chain
Money in your face while you getting none today
Money rules all, I got some up in the safe
Run up at the bank, put the weapon off safety
Mick Foley masked with a bitch like Sable
Bentley coupe crashin', blunts I'm cashin'
Lovin' every second, bitch, why you lookin' mad?
Corduroy house shoes, bitch it's like that
Writing these lyrics is like cashing these fucking checks

I'm bouncin', bouncin', one million ounces
Sleeping in the trunk, 'nother mill up at the house, bitch
You on the couch shit, never get out shit
I'm on the rap shit, getting money rapping

Let me ride to the beat
Ride to the beat, let me ride to the beat
Let me ride to the beat
#
I hit the three wheel motion
I'm guttin' swishers while I'm mixin' up the potion
My rims like thorns, always stay pokin'
Bath full of cash, got lungs full of roses
These white kids don't impress me
On something one week, off that next week
Black skully no shirt gold links
I'm the best cracker rapper, flow give 'em cold feet
Drown in the bass, drown in my ways
The water gets deep and my mind starts to change
Actin' like you in it to win it but you just in it for pictures
See, you just in it to talk about it
You just it in it to picture yourself on stage
Givin' crowds what they need to get wild, get buck, get hype
Born in the day I was raised in the night
See, young fuckin' ghost, good luck tryna fight me
Always with the team, you know where to find me
Always seems to be the white kids that don't like me
Ain't about race no, it's all about sound
But my mind starts talking and it's speakin' out loud
Thinkin' out loud, I'm just talkin' to myself
Should I give the game life? Should I give the game death?
#
Sittin' all alone, I'm off a lotta drugs
Ridin' on chrome, I'm with a lotta thugs
We don't want none and that's a promise to you
See you all alone, you don't want no problems do ya?
Break it, break it, break it down for ya
Bitches see my blunts and say "I'll break 'em down for ya"
Break it, break it, break it down for ya
I got a lot of thugs sayin' "I'll burn the town for ya"
Ya'll stay fly, I'd rather fall with style
The river in my cup, it help me flow just like the Nile
It helps me break it down, it help me get my zone
The phantom of this rap shit, I'm going, going, ghost
Strung the fuck out, I'm too fuckin' cashed
Velour snow suits, skiing down a mountain of ash
Got a cup full of water, it help me flow like water
I'm drippin' on the beat, I'm overflowin' when I'm going
See they all know my name, I'm bangin' round the globe
They know I'm with the team, that's Sesh 'til I'm gone
That skinny white thug, allergic to givin' fucks
Don't like that way I'm rappin', sorry bitch, you outta luck
#
Uh, SESH
Blunts in the graveyard, just Bones
Feeling so at home, ash on the tombstone

Blunts in the graveyard, that's just Bones
Feeling so at home, ash on the tombstone
Tales from the crypt, I could tell you bout' it all
TeamSESH on the wall, skeletons in the hall
See I O.D., and then I go to sleep
Wake up in a week with some gold on my teeth, I'm dead
So now you cannot kill me, no
Ghosts on the flow, bullets go right through me
See, I don't need a nine cause I'm good with that knife
Got my name on the blade so you know who took your life
Columbine when I strike, reptile in the night
I'm frozen, sub zero in my ice
My wrist bling blingin', my long hair swingin'
I'm feelin' like Wayne back in 98' spittin (SESH)
No limit soldier, blowing on the doja
In the back seat of that all black rover
In that all black rover, in the back seat yelling no limit soldier
Actin' like I'm from the no, but I'm not, thought I told ya

We ridin' (Bitch)
We slidin' (What?)
We ridin' (SESH)
We slidin' (Bitch)

Diamonds, money, murder (What?)
Bitches causing burners (Yuh)
Love, hate, proportion (Fuck)
Life, death, extortion (Aye)
No hell no fucking heaven (Yuh)
Just the thoughts of a fucking legend
#
Mister ten below
Mr. freeze with the flow
Ridin' to the sto'
Slingshot up in the door
These bitches know it's Bones
I'm young but I'm grown
The black trench coat hide the switchblade chrome
I let my wrist glow I let my neck shine
My pinky ring bling Rolex on time
They call me young god
They prayin' to the lord
I blessed them with the a flow and a beat and they good
I look like 22 I tote that 22 until I say I'm 18 they don't know what to do
I'm moving in the coupe
I'm pimpin' in the civic
It's 1992 we in the alleyways chillin
All black rags with the fools gold chain
TalesFromTheCrypt take them back to the days
Back to the ways back to the grave
Back to the lake take 'em back to the wave
SESH

I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I keep's me a nine millimeter just in case
A coward's in my face
These bullets he gone taste

See, I don't wanna die so I keep on me a nine
See, I just need some time to prove that the world is mine
Don't gotta say I'm dope, 'cause they already know
The Th@ Kid flows like [?] from the store
These bitches already heard me
These bitches already swerving
These bitches already calling, it ain't even 7:30
See, Timberland my boots
Versace on the suit
Rolex on my wrist, chunk the dukes and bang the Screw
See, I ain't down south (No)
I ain't up north (Yuh)
I ain't west coast nor east, I am tourin' (Yuh)
I'm everything you know, from that '94
The sound of chopper shells slowly droppin' to the floor
I'm sippin' and blowin' my O's
I'm grippin' and pourin' the fo'
I'm bangin' and swangin', I'm movin' and cruisin'
I'm lookin' at you and I'm slammin' the fuckin' door
Let it go, I'm in my zone
Look at my eye like "Fuck you on?"
Drugs in my blunt like fuck, I'm gone
With the fuckin' team and we fuckin' on, bitch

I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps
I only fuck with those who only fuck with me
A sucker play for games, a man play for keeps

Bowls in the night, blunts in the day
Dope in my sock, high's what I gotta stay
12:45 AM on the street
Sitting on the curb, smokin'
Strike the match and then I light the pipe
Light the night, young nightlight
I look good in that nightlight
My skin glisten, my chain shine
Feeling like the fucking world's mine
Scarface in his fucking prime
Got a pet tiger that live outside
So if you thinking about jackin', you better fucking think twice
Have that 9, you better take my life
Cold shoulder in the hot nights
I'll tuck you in and send you off right
Then I'll let the switchblade give you a kiss goodnight, bitch

I'm getting high as fuck, and yelling at the clock
Please slow down, cuz I don't wanna die yet
Bowls in the night,  blunts in the day
Dope in my sock, high's what I gotta stay
12:45 AM on the street
Sitting on the curb, smoking weed

Young nightlight
#
I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93

I had to take it back, back to the days
New white shirt, you could still see the crease
Pager on my hip, drugs by the key
Ghost-white limo, cocaine limousine
Different color syrups, different color weed
Your girlfriend love me cause I make her feel free
Whatever that mean, bitch, it's okay
We could ride around all night, all day
Rollin' up these blunts and blowin' 'em to the breeze
See, I ain't tryin' to fuck, I'm tryin' to smoke, now roll up three
Now she say she high, say I'm about to leave
Kiss up on the cheek, I grab the keys and hits the streets
Leather bucket seats, candy painted Chevy
Inside peanut butter, outside jelly

I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93
I got a fuckin' gold rope hanging round my neck
Gold Cadillac just to match the Rolex
Two or three rings every time I do my thing
The kid from '94 but the flow from '93

Mask to my fucking face
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Mask to my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip

Young white pimp riding in the whip
Coke white caddy with the all black tint
Gold on his neck, got gold on his wrist
Platinum in his mouth thats the motherfucking kid
He don't need a clique, he just need a clip
He don't need a grip cause he ain't never slip
He don't need a bitch cause all they do is trip
And he don't got time to hear all that shit
Thats Bones and he don't play like that
But if you try to play with him he can play right back
If you try to play dumb, boy you better play guns
Boy you better play hide, boy you better play run
Just a pimp from that 1994
Coming straight from the motherfucking West Coast
Where they all got guns
Use your head or you walk around with none

Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip
Ass on my fucking face
With an AK on my fucking hip

Rappers ain't shit in the 90's, I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick, but they ain't shit so motherfuck 'em
I'm in my six four
Got it jumping like it's nothin'
Somebody tried to jump me, tried to play me for a sucka
A pistol to my head, got a pistol in the glove
I ripped that bitch out, and let that mothafucka bust
Got a kevlar vest, right under the shirt
Creeping with that heater
Don't you get that ass MURKED
Bringing the wikkity sounds, it's that West Coast thugster
Lyrically serving crack to these South Side hustlers
The North Side murderers
The East Side slangers
The West Coast bangers
And these mothafuckin' RVIDXRS
Bringing it all the way back
It's the return of the Mack
Mac-10 clips ready to bang on attack
Alizé sipping, rolling blunts in the 'Lac
Sitting sideways, bustas don't know how to act
But bitch you already know, that I got that G-Funk
Try and press your luck and meet that purp up in the trunk
Never hesitate to lay a busta on his back
So if you talking trash meet that fucking compact
#
Everyone know my name
Everyone know my face
Everyone know my chain
Everyone know my ring
Everyone know I go
Everyone know I flow
Everyone know I'm crack
Everyone know I'm dope
Everyone know I'm Bones
So these women they calling my phone
These females they trying to blow
Cause my skin the same color as coke
Going ghost, going gone
Riding with that firearm
Fire alarms going off
The final warning, final call see
I know that you hate me
I know you can't take it
The second you saw that I'm starting to make it
You starting to hate it, I'm starting to love it
Spit it so lovely, nobody could touch it
Then again who wanna?
In the backseat of that hummer
Rolling cigars full of drugs
Bumping that number one stunner
Let me ride it out
187s and I'm hiding out
Young white punk with a blunt in his mouth
Switchblade in his sock
Don't make him pull it out

I'm gone, I'm zoning
I, I, I'm zoning
I flow like water when I'm alone and I'm fucking zoning
Bitch I'm, I'm zoning
I, I, I'm zoning
I flow like water when I'm alone and I'm fucking zoning
Bitch I'm...

Just another 24 in that californ-i-a
The blunts gettin' rolled and the pimps gettin' paid
It's all day all night ridin' to the flow, cuz it's just another 24

The kids outside and the sun is shinin, it's just another 24
The pimps still pimpin' and their rings still blindin', it's just another 24
Ridin' up the block to the store for some OE, it's just another 24
When i'm on the block hear my name guess they know me, it's just another 24

I slide to the right, i side to the left, i slide in my ride put the tape in the deck
I turn on the alpine let that blast, i got my windows down so they can see me when i pass
I'm coolin', cruisin', ballin' like Ewing, house-shoes on bitch i'm 1992-in
Sun kinda bright so i throw on my shades, cartier frames keep the sun out my face
I know i been sinnin', but know i'm never prayin', angels on my dick like i'm on the cross hangin'
Blunts in the manger, say it's too danger, risk take a risk as i load up my banger
Click-click, boom, don't fear it
Bones on ya block and i know these suckers hear it
But i don't ever hear them, that's with the 24
It's just another day it's just another 24

The kids outside and the sun is shinin, it's just another 24
The pimps still pimpin' and their rings still blindin', it's just another 24
Ridin' up the block to the store for some OE, it's just another 24
When i'm on the block hear my name guess they know me, it's just another 24

White punk on dope
Black bitch on coke
Say she feel like dying
I said I feel real throwed
Neck drippin' in gold
Bitch knows that I'm Bones
Bitch know that we fuck
Then I gotta go ghost
Gotta ride around with my team, Ride around with that lean
Since I ride around with my Ice, I gotta ride around with that heat

Know what I'm sayin'.....sesh.....what...Bones

Yeah, Skeletons in my closet
Rap game in my pocket
Got a 64 with hydraulics
And 44 that stay knocking
Marble floors when im walking
Big blunts so I'm coughing
Platinum cover my headstone, got diamonds all over my coffin
Dave up in the kitchen
Bitches all at admission
Brother's  bringing me gold chains
My blunt wraps and my slippers
House shoes and a big robe
Living life like Deathrow
94' like im on tour, with a bulletproof fucking vest on
Like go ahead bitch shoot me
Put a cut to my movie
With a bullet you can take my life, but you can never take what it could be
What the fuck that I would've been
What the fuck my son will be
Where I would've been at 21
Where I would've been at 23
See even if you fucking kill me now
You still ain't doing shit
You're still too fucking late
I'm the Skinny White Pimp Bitch
Bones
#
Sipping on that Tanqueray
Feeling like it's fucking 98
Raindrops on my windshield
Just get me proof, I seen brighter days
Swinging lanes in that caddy
Stuntin' like my daddy
Blown switches at the red lights
And pouring up on the alleys
See, the cops really don't like me
But then again, motherfuck 'em
Cause the only thing they try to see
Is a white pimp get busted
A couple chains on my neck
Let me know they ain't take 'em yet
I pay dues, I catch the check
And I get flow, so pay respect

Tanqueray in my system
The bassline I'm flowin'
Slidin' 'round your city
My diamonds shinin', they glowin'
Tanqueray in my system
The bassline I'm flowin'
Slidin' 'round your city
My diamonds shinin', they glowin'

They know I'm screaming "fuck they"
Till the day I'm in the dirt
Boy, I'm screaming "fuck they"
#
On my knees in the night, seeing prayers in the street
Fuck that, fuck god, all I fucking need is me
I be tripping on the beat, bitch, tripping on your feet
I've be flowing all day, now all of my clothes free
Young white mac riding in the 'lac
Mac on his lap and his fucking seat back
Fucking seats black, dope look white
Powder on the dash, one line in the fire

I'm blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
Blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled

Going, going ghost, swinging up the coast
Lighter in my right, in the other bag of dope
Life through the scope, death by the bullet
I see you on the range, don't make me fucking pull it
I inhale the beat, I exhale the flow
I live for this shit and I got just to know
That I am the best, the beast in the flesh
6 foot, 3 fools gold on his neck

I'm blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
Blown, blown, out of control
Guns off safety, triggers getting pulled
#
Hoe in the back, got a hoe in the front
One cooking the crack, one rolling the blunt
It's easy, easy, bitch don't believe me
I'm riding through your city bumping Cash Money, Weezy
El says get 'em, J I got 'em
Me plus the beat, that's a motherfucking problem
Swerving Impalas, thinking never stop them
They can send shots but they can never drop them
Yeah, they got money and I know they got hoes
I know they got whips and all the designer clothes
But do they have a sewer full of rats that'll crack fucking bats
To the back of these crackers and fucking laugh
MAC-10 attack, it's the AK to spray
I'm the beef in the night, I'm the thug in the day
I'm the drugs in the blunt, I'm the light in the flame
I'm the sickest you ever witness, I'm sick of fucking saying
I'm saying

I'm doing fucking drugs and getting real famous
I'm doing lot of drugs and I'm getting real famous
You waking up early just to drag that ass to work
Same shit everyday until you're in the dirt
#
Rolex diamonds, cadillac driving
Arm out the window, stunting while I'm sliding
Smoke while roll, roll when I choke
When I bust out a flow, sound like it's 94
And I feel like 96, blowing on that pine drowe
In the back of the 'lac, rolling to the condo, bitch
People going off, ninas going down
Pays your buzz, best believe you are get down
'Cause the guns up against you
And the bullets, they will hit you
Bitch, it ain't even an issue
It's a cold world, don't let it get you
If you try to slide, maybe we can ride
If you try to slide, maybe we can ride
#
I don't need no money, I don't need no cars
I don't need no bitches, like I'm a fucking star
But why you acting hard, you know you fucking not
I've been around your block, been up in your girls spot
Bitch, she telling me all the shit that she'll never tell you
She been telling me all the ways that I'm better than you
Stop playing, I'm the man and you know that it's true
In her dreams she getting fucked but you know that it ain't you

Vintage clothes, give up the flow
She likes to go fast, I'm fucking her slow
People always ask how I got so sick
I tell 'em "ditch school, do drugs and never trust a bitch"

Underage and I'm underpaid
The best rapper, that's an understate
Meant to make, I wasn't meant to make
I fucking pop pimp, while you fucking fake
Your girlfriend, she like me
You best believe, I don't like her back
She wanna fuck, I'm just trying to lax
While she trying to ride my Cadillac

The lights down, the team up
All we do is sesh, all we roll is blunts
The lights down, the team up
All we do is sesh, all we roll is blunts

Let me tell you a little story
About a pimp named Bones
Always ride with that chrome, never left the chrome at home
See parked up in the parking lot
Pimping all the hoes
Feet hanging out the window
Rolling bones, blowing O's
40 ounces of alcohol in my bottle, bumping juvenile
400 degrees in my Impala
Bitch its 1996, leanin' on that switch
I fucked that ho once, but I ain't called that bitch since
Boy im beating up your block, feel the bass I know you heard me
That skinny white pimp
With that black Glock 30
6'3", gold chain in the jersey
Bitches know its Bones when they see that Chevy swervin'


What?
We just parking lot pimpin'
Parking lot pimpin, bitch
Parking lot pimpin, yeah(x2)


He look just like a ghost, when you see him in the night
Skin glowing like stars, every time you hit the light
Tanqueray in my flask
Pile of ash, on the dash
Few more ounces in the glove, rolling blunts till' it's death
They looking at me strange
I tell 'em its just SESH
They ask me what that means
Buncha blunts to the neck
That's the motherfucking team, we don't need your respect
All we need is a beach, a little bit of drugs on the set...

Sesh
Yeah
Sesh (What)
Th@ Kid (What)
Yeah
What, what, what

All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long
All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long

Cigar full of drugs
I take it to my lungs, I feel it in my veins
Bitch i’m as high as fucking nutz
Mountain full of ash, let you know i’m fucking ca$hed
All I do is rap, bitch all I do is SESH

Riding up the block with my brothers, bumping my shit (my shit)
When I hear my shit, I can’t believe that it’s my shit
Now I am eighteen, dropped out at sixteen
Out in LA and they all still back in Michigan

All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long
All we do is drugs
All we do is smoke
All we do is roll blunts all day long

Got a body in the trunk, ain't no turnin back
My mama taught be better, Still I don't know how to act
It's 1997 so I'm ridin with the strap
Been out for 5 years, but I'm sure that I'll be back
Back in the pen, just a life of hard crime
There's one too many dollars on my motherfuckin' mind
One too many rocks, now I'm doin' hard time
Caught me servin' on the block, say it's only part time
But you know the story, or at least how it goes
You never want what'chu got 'till it's all gone
A hundred down the road, all the windows down
I know a vacant lot that we can put him in the ground
I'm thinkin' about my future, now I'm thinkin' about my child
I wonder if I live to know the color of her eyes
Looking at the skies, don't even believe in god
Body in the trunk so there's no turnin' around

Got a body in the trunk, ain't no turnin back
My mama taught be better, Still I don't know how to act
(yeah... SESH...)

Got these hoes all in the pole
And they all gon' get to strippin'
Got your bitch closed on the floor
And your girl up against that wall, and she
Drop it
Drop it
Down to the floor
24 blocks, I ain't even twenty-fo'
I pick my weapons like, "eeny, meeny, miny, moe"
Hop up in the limo then I hit the fuckin' corner store, now
Countin' cold hard cash in my limousine
Shag rags floors glass full of that promethazine
Big water slides
Big flat screens
Blank check life, Macintosh with the green
Been around the block
Seen a lot of death
Paid a lot of dues
Paid a lot of debts
Still, I keep that Glock when I leave my spot
Cuz you never know when shit might pop
Off at any given moment on the clock

Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love

It's 1992, blunts on the stoop
Just got some new shoes to match my new tool
Brand new tech, all gold clip
Diamond hollow tips with a ruby red grip
Bathtub of cash, living life lavish
30 blunts later and I'm still getting cash
Skinny White Pimp, but you can call me Bones
Blanco skin, chain made of fools gold

We popping Cristal, we just live in the now
Nobody promised tomorrow so all we got is the now
See all I got is my flow, see all I got is my team
See all I got is my money, just please don't come in between
Because I don't give a fuck about taking a life
I'll do a 9-5 to prove I'm about that life
You see the coke white skin and my big ass diamonds
Swanging lane to lane, hat low, profiling
Kid's on the playground, I was inside
Writing my thoughts down but in the form of rhymes
Never gave a fuck I'm not even about to lie
Every time I rap I do it like I'm about to die
Cuz life it's been changing, the rolls been rearranging
Got a 4 door Platinum Lexus
Bass locked in the trunk just banging

It's 1992, blunts on the stoop
Just got some new shoes to match my new tool
Brand new tech, all gold clip
Diamond hollow tips with a ruby red grip
Bathtub of cash, living life lavish
30 blunts later and I'm still getting cash
Skinny White Pimp, but you can call me Bones
Blanco skin, chain made of fools gold

Don't be acting clever
You might end up in an ambulance
Stuck Never leave and never dance
Ridin in that caravan
Holdin onto hella clips
Bout' to let em go
Whaddya know?

Cookin up some evil shit
Schemin on that Memphis shit
Long distance calls, over the phone
That's just my Memphis bitch
Roll my blunts delicate
Drugs in my system now
Always turn my system up
Never turn my system down
Bangin on the curbs
Ridin round with my fuckin team
Chevy with the bucket seats
Feelin like it's 93'
No [?] in my deck
Let them sneakers bleed
Posted with my evil deeds
To let my fuckin demons feed

What
Yeah
Sesh

Flows gotta be the closest thing to heaven
Rollin up the block pullin' 187s
Sippin' on a bottle full of cough suppressants

You've never been this high before
You've never been this high before

Rollin' blunts, blowin' hoes
Would they know than I'm getting so cold
Lookin down at the Earth below
Flow dynamite and it's about to blow
I can't believe just what I'm seen
From the sunrises to the evenings
Everyday is like a motion picture
Lights camera and it's fuckin action
Groovy fashion, weed assassin
Rag came direct just for askin
Always rappin, always hashin
Always pimpin, always mackin

You've never been this high before
You've never been this high before

Fill up my cup
Roll up my blunt
She 'bout to OD
I feed her more drugs
She 'bout to black out
I tell her pop this
She say she too high
I say she ain't shit
She say she need help
I say she need this
Roll up a blunt and then light up a flick
Lit the end and pass the back shit
She take a hit
I take a breath
That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead

That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead
She say she need some help
I say I need some head
That bitch strung out
That bitch almost dead
She say she need some help

Comin' up quick as I snickered so sick
Mac on my lap, I got a ten in the clip
One for my bitch, I got one for the snitch
One in the trunk, I got two in the ditch
One in the river and one in the woods
One in the freezer and one at the school
Put on my hat and then bring out the tool
Reload the clip and then aim it at you
Bang, never shot a gun at a human being
And that's a rule I promise myself I will never break
I didn't bring you in, I'm not gonna take you out
Except for your bitch, she know I'm The Kid so she want me to take her out
She want me to take her down, to the underworld
Young scorpion, get over here I told you, girl
I'm the fucking man, bringing that white noise
Gold chain shinin', fuck these other white boys
Cuz I'm the right now, and you're the never man
With my large boys killing blunts out in Neverland
Bricks in the caravan, iced out everything
Wood grain when I switch lanes
Paint dripping like candy mane

Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
Jump into the Chevy, hit the dashboard, get the mask
Jump into the Chevy

I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are
The only things that you'll need
The only feelings that you'll feel
When you riding down that road, with all of the windows down
I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are

Ok, I'm ridin' round in that Cadillac
Mr. Magic that rap attack
I been rappin' since the fuckin' age of 6, I been fuckin' the game y'all can have it back
Blunt smoke in my habitat, hit it once and then pass it back
Them flashbacks keep flashin' back like flashlights playin' flash tag
Ash that then I kick that, shit off the richter
I been in this rap game, flow feel like December
That bass in your system, that snare, and that kick-drum
That feelin' you get when you got the top down bumpin' this song

I'm in my Cadillac swinging on twenty fours
I've got the tape deck loud and the block on froze
I'm in my Cadillac feeling like its '94, money come money go but the memories are
The only things that you'll need
The only feelings that you'll feel
When you riding down that road, with all of the windows down

I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac
I'm in my Cadillac

Motherfuck these white kids, I promise I ain't like them
I'm in the streets rapping, they locked in their room writing
I put this shit down from Howell all the way to Brighton
Got a Glock in my trunk and I'm picking it up and then striking your ass like lightning
I'm saying, don't fuck with me, I mean fuck with me, but don't fuck with me
I got a backpack that's full of cutlery and I'm cut throat
Now trust in me, like God
Now pray to me, like Christ
I'm high as fucking shit and I'm white so I guess it's only fucking right
That I do it how it's never ever been fucking done
I blow caution to the breeze like that smoke that's in my lungs
Really rapping, really living all that shit I fucking rap about
30 blunts, 50 minutes that's what the fuck I'm talking about
44's stay poking out
Might slide down to Oakland now
Blow potent out
Windows down
Eyes up and down
That coast now
I'm ghost now, I'm dead
I'm not white, I'm not black
I'm not sick, I'm not dope, I'm not coke, I'm not crack

Dope in my sock, run another block
Drugs in my veins, keep going, can't stop
Chains banging off my chest
Bright white skin, young Eliot Ness
See I'm in my own space with my It's time to face the tests, it's time to face the tests
See I take a jet on the way to Mars
Just to prove that you ain't high as us, I'm cashed
Yeah, I'm cashed
Cash signs on my eyes, I guess I smoked too much
Cash signs on my eyes but fuck it roll another blunt
I'm cashed, yeah
Bitch I'm cashed
Life's too fast so let me slow it down
The only motherfucker to ever get out of Howell
The only fucking reason that you think about leaving town
But just look at you now, just look at you now
Diamonds turn to dirt, back where they came
Safe to say that I'll do the same when it's my fucking day
Until then I'mma roll this haze, kick these raps and do my thang
Every day's a movie scene when you fucking live like me
Got that frostbite, got that heat, bathe in a bathtub full of lean
Diamonds overflow my chain
Young Charmander with that flame
Snare go "bap" and the bass go "bang", spark it with my fucking team
Little of rap just a little of me
T-H-@ K-I-D

Knocking pictures off the wall, letting my fucking speakers be
Keep it pimping
Never tripping
Never slipping
Grain ripping
Bitch I'm different, water sipping
In the alley behind your building
Where I'm spitting
My sentences kill 'em no matter what
I say the shit I spit and the flows I kick turn grey skies to sunny days
Past the sunny haze
Riding in bucket seat
Turn the bass up and feel like nobody can fuck with me

Thirty blunts to the face, everything slow mo'
Everything slowed down, can't feel my legs no mo'
Hanging out the sun-roof yelling "Yo-Yo-Yo"
Sling shot on the floor, bag of rocks and the dope
Bout to load it, aim it, cock it back and just let it go
Let me flow, let me flow, motherfucker just let me go
White noise on your T.V. let you know you ain't alone

Fuck the world I smoke a blunt blow an ounce in a night
Moved out my folks so I can tell her the house is ours tonight
Chain like the arka light
Girl look like posh spice
Killer with no intentions and that's it for having off-night
Can't even talk right I'm going too hard
Raising the bar and I ain't even got a car

Go, go, put this shit in slow-mo
Chop-chop and screw it, bang it, bang it in your low bo
Riding through Soho

Young Jeff Hardy, Swanton Bombing
I’m comin' down like Owen Hart but I ain’t fucking fallin'
I’d rather fall in style, so you may call it fly
But I don’t like to use these words other people like
I’d rather that you hate me, your girl she want to rape me
She say that I’m the best but I ain’t really into labels
Voted in school number one most hated
Voted in life most likely to fuckin' make it so I made it bitch
Now take it, don’t fake it, I know you fuckin' like it
18 livin' life how I motherfuckin' wanna
Y'all sittin' at your moms wishing you could get out
Can’t relate, left the house when I turned 16, fuck you talkin' bout
Fresh up out the slaughterhouse, fire-young dragon mouth
Jean jacket, shredded pants, Casey Jones in the house
The heat in the drought, the breeze in the night
The weed in the blunt and the flame to make it light
Breakin' these necks and I’m gettin' respect
Cuttin' these bitches like cuttin' these checks
And I’m fuckin' these beats like I’m fuckin' my bitch
And I’m fuckin' my bitch like I’m bustin' my clip
Like ‘Bang, bang’ and reload it, I cock back then I shoot it
See, I'm a night rat till I O.D or some shit real stupid
It’s like these females think I’m Cupid, they always actin' goofy
Bitch I don’t fuckin' like you therefore I don’t want to do it
Ho I pull up in that Prowler, blunt lit loud up
In the backseat, rollin' bo’s up, my graveyard too piled up
They tell me stop smokin', but I don’t give a fuck
Throw a middle finger up, fuck you and your fuckin' God
Bitch I pray to myself, I am the most highest
These rappers they say they smokin' but we know they fucking lying
They just trying to appeal to the kids, well bitch I am one
Hot Sauce flow, breakin' ankles like And-1
Kidnap the beat, leave a note for ransom
Young Heartbreak Kid, bitch your mom think I’m handsome
#
Let me tell you a little story about a skinny white pimp
Got the heater on his lap, got a beeper on his hip
In the parking lot slangin mixtapes out the whip
Drop the top, hit the switch, watch the trunk do tricks
#

Still ain't got a license so I'm riding shotgun
Shotgun cock some white pigs that pop guns
These pop stars platinum fuck that
I want some, act like you want none
Bitch i know you want some
Sickest bar none, words i got them
You're favorite rapper, well i probably taught them
Drugs i bought and bang like someone shot them
Fuck them cut them, it's soft like cotton
Bitches probably [?] rhymes must be if you talking bout a white kid that is not me
You pop like lolly, i don't fuck with molly
Cup full of those jollies, in my syrup drowning
Robert Downey my white skin, shine bright like lightning
My white benz my white friends say my shit so fucking sick
If they don't like it tell em suck a dick
Tell them th@ kid bring some weapons in
I must have been like fucking six
When i was on my bed, screaming fuck the pigs
Plastic clip in my plastic mag
Orange tip spraying hella shots
Not acting white not acting black
Just acting how i fucking wanna act
Nose full of coke sock full of crack
Big gold rope yelling 80 stack
Grand-master flash, just ashing fast
If you tryna sesh just pass the test
Acid best, face better
Morning needs the dam way i said  it
My females a master piece
I might just shed a tear, don't let me fucking shed it
Don't let me fucking shed it, boutta shed a tear
Don't let me fucking shed it

Sesh

Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me


Switchblade kids play, digital dash display
Grippin' on that woodgrain, cubes in my kool aid
Chains on my neck, hangin' like Jesus Christ two fools gold hair and bone pieces
Jeans with the crease spark a blunt full of demons
Candy paint drippin' leavin' trails in the streets

Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me
Switchblade on my waist don't press me

Switchin' lanes, poppin' trunks, showin' out for all these bitches
Dashboard scotty Pippin, Woodgrain grippin'
Tape deck on blast, speakers in my truck kickin'
#

There's an ounce and a half in the bag
There's a new pack of swishers on the dash
There's a tape in the deck
There's a foot up on the gas
There ain't' no car on the road
So I'm about to go fast
Got a rap on smash
Got that sling-shot on my lap
Got a bag full of rocks
I ain't' slanging no crack
Just a young dumb fuck
With the tendencies to blast
Like blastoise hydro-pump this bullet through my gat
Through your brain, catch the fake
Can't just can't just catch a break
Tired of kicking out all these flows
And drowning bitches with my waves
That's a lie, I ain't tired I do this shit like every day
Motherfuck the VMAs, motherfuck these record labels
I ain't' trying to make a name, I ain't' trying to get the fame
I'm just trying to get some change, go and cop a bigger chain
Buy a house for my team, basement full of weed
'fridgerator full of drinks, champagne and sunny D
Fuck a big flat screen, got a movie theater in my room
Big chairs everywhere glass screen bullet proof

Don't ask what's good, the answers me
And don't ask who I'm with, I'm with the team
I'm guttin' blunts, I'm cuttin' trees
Young lumberjack with the rolled up sleeves
Rolled up jeans blowin' rolled up leaves
Ashin' out the window to the cold cut breeze
Cold cut team with the cold cut dream
NIP till I RIP
Please, believe me, I been killin' these beats and bury them in a burial underneath the streets
Under my [?] in the bleachers I never see ya waitin' near the rejack
When we went outlaw, like road dog, and we were bad boys like DX
Throw an XD and then suck it
See we don't give a fuck we say fuck it
Fuck that and fuck Dave get ripped away but get out the way

Stylish rag on my belt buckle, niggas talk tough but they felt knuckles
Rollin this dope while she cock back the [?] lookin' for demons
[?] niggas get high listenin' to Pimp C

Don't mess with Texas they tell you before
Smokin' this low, tippin' the foes

I ain't gonna stop you, you can do just what you want
You know where to find me if you ever need some drugs
Rollin' up a blunt, smokin' wicked till the sun came up
And then we roll another one


I got these drugs in my veins, got these drugs in my veins
Every time i roll a blunt i just think about your face
Now these sheets gettin clothed
Every day after day i'm just tryna get rich so i can finally fuckin' say
Don't worry bout a thing you already know i got it
Condo in the valley got a trap house out in compton
Always done what i wanted, so why should this be different
Dropped out, moved away, got rich off spittin
I'm gettin' rich off my business, SESH raps in yo dispensaries
Neck drippin' in fake gold fuck all your accessories
Quit with all the peasantry, i give the beat the best of me
I break it down roll it up and pass whatever's left to me


I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life
#
Swishin' the game
Grippin' the grain
Takin' the picture and flippin' the frame
Blunts to the the face that's every day
Love it so much i might marry the Jane
Now fuck that, that's corny shit, but it rhyme right so i said it bitch
I'm chillin' bitch on my lavish shit, you ain't no where close to my level bitch
Big minerals on my [?] bitch
Fresh fruit, flood my plate
Stay out my rays like a freckle bitch
Cuz you are my son and i am your maker
Ridin' scrapers, out in Vegas on the old strip goin' 88
Too many drugs i think i'm bouta faint, but we got too many rolled i ain't waitin'
I ain't bout praying
I ain't bout makin' up gods in my head to help me get through the day
I ain't bout the rain I ain't bout the pain
I kick hella raps and smoke hella weed
That's just me, that's just SESH
18 and i get better like every day of my fuckin' life
I got a million in my hand and it's bouta take flight like
#
Sunset, hazy eyes
Blunt light ice tonight
Everything's in sight
Everything feels so
Slow down, SESH

Yeah
Sunset hazy eyes
Blunt light ice tonight

Pullin' up feet hangin' out the window
Tippin' four fours bout to blow like Nintendos
Only but my own shit so i ride real slow
Time to go hard so i'm breakin' out the steel tones
Females love me they put nothin' above me
Call me room heaven cuz it's where i feel godly
Fuck your Bugatti I pull up on a bike, blunt hangin' out my mouth speed and pass you at the light
Like Jesus Christ how we get so high, bloodshot eyes hardly open while i ride just a weird white kid that gets way too high and approaches microphones just to speak in rhymes
Like testing, 1, 2 am i coming through?
Swangin' lane to lane sippin' on that screw juice
Never fuckin' gonna shoot, never gonna kill, never fuckin' gonna stop, never fuckin' gonna chill
Only gonna fuckin' stack my paper on top of that
All I wanna do is rap, so i'm fuckin' doin' that
Dreamt a dream when i was 6, so i'm fuckin' chasin' that
Tool bus, hundred blunts, 30 ounces in the back
Degeneration SESH, throw a sucker then we jet


Long hair bandana young XPac bitch
Young XPac bitch

Long hair, bandana, young XPac bitch

The bass knockin', bitch open up
Go pour a cup, if you smoke, roll a blunt
Brand new ounce, young and full of drugs
Still not giving it up, still not giving a fuck
I couldn't stop rappin' if i fuckin' tried to
They say this shit was sick bitch, trust me you're being lied to
Mountain full of ash that's too raps times two
Your shit may be awesome but my shit's fuckin' colossal
My shits underground my genre should just be fossil
TeamSesh, fuck Dave, yep that's the motto
Came through ice around my neck young gelato
Remember when my teacher said I wouldn't make it far though
Now I don't leave my house without one of my chains on though
Only spend a thousand if i need to let the trunk blow
Rappin' all day smoking weed in my condo
Me and my fuckin' team killin' beats till the sun go down
And even when it do we still love guttin' blunts
Don't worry it's what we do
One ounce, one day, 30 raps to the face, new high, new fade, new money to fuckin' make
300 something songs, 19 fuckin' mixtapes
Your whole catalogue of music's a mistake
Your shit's so fifth place, mine's so first
Been rhyming since the cradle, imma rhyme until the hearse, I murk
Ever verse I blurt, kids so dope, flow so berserk
#

It's 4 in the morning, we ridin' round we rollin'
We seshin'
We smokin'
We go till we chokin'
We fall asleep in Oakland, we wake up in Paris
We all around the world, kickin' raps and gettin higher


The motherfuckin' team, ya you already know
The motherfuckin' team bumpin' out your stereo
The motherfuckin' team
Ya
The motherfuckin' team
#
A kid like me, i'm always on my grind
24/7 bitch you know where to find
A kid like me, smokin' lot of pine
16 raps that's 32 to life
High without a flight, hype without a mic
Never lose focus, been rappin' like all my life
Used to ditch class, to rap in the hall
Beats off my phone, lyrics off my dome
Jewels on my neck, waist on my chrome
Chrome on my waist, make no difference if you wrong
Click-clack boom, catch yo ticket to yo tomb
Your favorite rapper gone, i'm still on the stoop, bitch
#

I don't really give a fuck ride with the system up
Put it down for my team tell your bitch to pick it up
Drugs in the trunk, run forest run tell 'em don't stop get it how he wants
Get it how you live, that's what they always say
Blunt wrap killin' killin' blunts all day
Bars in the chain but I'm bout to let 'em spray
Duck down click clack bang bang
Everyday I see myself, gettin' little older
My only motivation to kill it until it's over
It's all i fuckin' need, some beats and my team
Fresh fruit up on my plate double Y full of greens
Tin foil on my teeth catchin' rays at the beach
Bitch
Tin foil on my teeth catchin' rays at the beach
#

It's hard to change but fuck it I'ma change rap to my bones in the grave till I'm home once again in the planet where I came
Roll blunt rock stage round the world in 80 days
It's the fuckin' team, flow nice smoke mean
All I do is kick raps
All I do is smoke weed
Fuck a job, chase a dream
Fuck dave, kill beats
Every day a movie scene when you livin' like me


It's nice to say but it's hard to change
#

Ohhhh time and time and time again
You've really been my only friend
Little did you know little did you know
You wanna die like gravity
Walking fucking travesty
Out the fucking back with me
I hope I never have to let her go
I hope I never have to let you go
#
Young Cleopatra
Bitch I'm so flashy
Gold all over like a prince call me Aladdin
See rappin' ain't a habit, I'm in it 'till the casket
My shit go hard and your shit go flaccid
Tragic, face it, your whole sound basic
My shit go bang you can hear it from the basement
Flows so faceman
Change and reshape shit
This ain't a fuckin' rap it's a fuckin' creation
This shit for the base heads
Get high off that basin
Your dude may talk shit, but I know he'll never say shit
Blunt rolled, team here, we on that fuck dave shit
Nightrats, wrap pack, ya they be on that same shit
#

Raps Andy Kaufman
Pullin' up 'raris
So fresh 'till death I should pull up in a coffin
Blunt got me coughin' that's how you know it's awesome
Weed from California but my motor so foreign
Yellow testarossa we came with a few horses
Motorola beeping wish bitches would quit callin'
Lookin' at my chain mouthes wide like they yawnin'
Screamin' TeamSesh and we ain't even fuckin' tourin'
Motherfuck your Nikes
Motherfuck your Jordans
Motherfuck your Gucci all that shit is just corny
But bitch it's all gravy
I'm not tryna change your expectations like a baby all I'm tryna do is raise 'em
Born in the bays so I'm cool with the raiders
Mixtapelegend more cuts than a razor
Subwoof bangin'
CD slangin'
Cash money records I ain't shinin' bitch I'm blangin'
Bitch I'm famous
Bitch I'm stainless
Not a scratch on me I'm the motherfuckin' cleanest like I'm fresh up out the cleaners
Flow be the meanest
Pants saggin' when I rap so I walk with a demeanor
Yeah
#
Sesh

Sitting on the stu
Fresh bowl of fruit
The sky is turing electric blue
The clouds are pink
My eyes are too
Bloodshot can't even move
I watch the sun when it rise up
And I watch the sun as it go down
And I watch the moon come up everynight
Shits unreal it's never slowing down

Its raining outside
I love the rain
I love the ocean
I love the eclipse
I love the water
I love the coffee
I love the whiskey
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I wish I wasn't a robot

If you're lookin' for a party song here bitch party on
Chillin' in my civic no top like Mardi Gras
Give me a second bout to get my Jeff Hardy on
On the top grove get my swan tom bombin' on
I skip the beef like Ramadan while everybody else pullin' triggers like firelarms
Money diamonds cars
Ounce in the jar
[?] flow flow like a leotard
You look at me and you see a star
Young nebula spittin' bars on mars
I rippin' bar for bar my shit is so underpar
My shit is so fuckin' sick
My shit is so fuckin' hard
My raps so fuckin' sesh and my girl the same
All we do is do drugs all night all day
In the shade blowin' haze it's the motherfuckin' team
Couple weird white kids with some weird ass dreams
Get rich, sex ships, and all that
I'm callin' to the universe I hope that bitch call back
Hit the blunt once and I feel like I'm fallin'
Dollar sign eyes too cash always sparkin'
Too cash always sparkin
Dollar sign eyes too cash always sparkin'
I'm always too cashed
Every time you see me
I'm always too cashed

McDonald's is really good for olympic swimmers
Yo


I've got a gold MAC-10 with some platinum bullets
Double dog dare trigger don't you dare me to pull it
Get the dogs to woof it
Get the team to hoof it
Get back to the cadillac parked behind the bushes
Got the mind of a killer with the plot I ain't a rookie
Put you in the cemetery so they don't smell the body
I been rowdy since the beginning, bitch i'm bout it if you bout it
If you ridin' then I'm ridin', if you shootin' then I follow
Eight rounds of them hollows
Water by the bottle
Got some drugs in the refrigerator chillin' till we on them
Trippin' and we fallin' like somebody tied our laces
High as fuck on the drugs, I know I probably shouldn't have laced it
Now I'm faced to fucking face with, the blunt that I been facin'
I take it to the face, that's what the fuck I call a face lift


Bass in the basement, weed in the garage, crack in the attic, meth in the trailer park
I'ma do it how I want, I'ma make this fuckin' guap
I'ma slang these fuckin' tapes, I'ma drop my fuckin' top
I'ma pop my fuckin' trunk, I'ma fuckin' ride it out
No roof on the whip screamin' fuck the world loud (loud)


Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud
No roof on the whip screamin' fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world loud (loud)
Fuck the world
Fuck the world
Fuck the world loud (loud, loud)

Blunts get rolled graveyards get Bones
Team gets high while the bass bang low
They say they got flow but we all know the don't
They say they smoke too but we all know they don't

Used to write shit, now I don't
WPOD, keep it dope
Used to write shit, now I don't
WPOD, keep it dope

White skin gold chain
It's only when it rains
Flashbacks runnin' through my mind like drugs in my veins
Everyday the same, tryna maintain this being I became
Blunts to the face
Everything cool, everything fine, everything grand
Money in my hand I got money in my hand
I could never leave rap you could never understand
Put your heart into a flow and you'll see what I'm sayin'
Never by the gram, always by the ounce
Got a place around the corner for a hundred for a pound
I'll show you what I'm bout, double Y when I like
Cup full of the [?] mix sunny to light
Bitch I'm high as a kite, I'm deceased as a corpse
Too cashed lookin' like a zombie when I walk (when I walk)
SESH

This is the time when you roll up all your drugs and get yourself together, ya know
#
Yeah, this goes out to all the ladies
In middle school, you guys used to take trips to Florida, Caribbean, whatever, doesn't matter, it's not about that
You would always come back with braids
My only question, why?
Why braids?
Why- why braids?

Gold chain renegade
Kill the blunt then kill the stage
King of the underground, slangin' all these mixtapes
Your whole sound bitch made, my shit rules
I'm addicted to flowin' I wake up and I act a fool
Young two thousand and four, in my white T yuh
Pants saggin' out my ass goin' high fee, yuh
Askin' me if i'm high, well bitch i might be yuh
In my no brand shoes settin' fire to some Nikes
Rock like diamonds, bars like Verizon
Rappin' to prove all of you how not to be like em
Fuck every rapper in existence i don't like em
And if you don't like me, fuck ya i don't like ya
I could be your best friend or i could be the bully, the reason why your ass ain't showin' up to school
The night rap posse, backpack full of tools, duck tape grip hammer if your home need improvin'
Got every sewer groovin' from LA way down to Yuma
Kickin' raps and makin' moves gotta get me paid and get shit movin'
Shower to a jacuzzi
Turn my TV to the movies
Turn my lent into some cash and get all of these cameras shooting
Pow, pow all these cameras shooting
Duck D-duck down, and just watch how they shoot me
Pow, pow all these cameras shooting
Now we bout to make a movie
SESH
Gold chain, gold chain renegade

I remember it so vividly, ice cold back roads life back in Michigan
How you supposed to miss it when nobody say they missin' ya
History down the drain but I am just as much to blame as the other half
Fuck it, I'm livin' life and I love it
As I'm now steady workin' workin' towards no budget
Towards that ferrari and that big ass apartment
Oh you thought I meant a room? Fuck no I meant a complex
Don't believe in objects, material things
But what the fuck why not when you bathin' in change
Just the way of the grain, way it grip to my hand
It's just the heat of the sun, it's just my feet in the sand
They got me hopin', I ain't ever gotta be broke again
Never sold drugs cuz I'd end up rolling them
End up smoking all the weed I was holding
End up gettin' smoked in an alley in Oakland
So I took the other route, I'ma be a fuckin' rapper
Been spittin' my whole life why not get some money off this shit, it's nonsense, but fuck it so it's life
You wake up every day you fall asleep every night
It's just so fuckin' crazy, I'm floatin' outta space
How could you waste a second bitchin' bout how much you make
How much you fuckin' hate stupid shit throughout your day
Just for me feel your heart feel the beat, fucking breath


Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang
Ya
SESH

New white shoes and a clean white tee
Skinny ass kid in skinny ass jeans
Jet black hair and a fake gold chain

Came with a team, yeah that's SESH
Blood red eyes where [?] at

By the end of this rap i'mma have you convinced that

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

A bike ride down memory lane
No dirt road, no D-19
Just LA streets and alleyways
Gettin' homies high behind the garbage can
We SESH rats we night rats if you didn't know
Couple kids, couple girls and a couple pre rolls
Shit heads and old tunes, something from the 20s or it's no good
You peasants, we sky less
We lead the trend, you follow
I'm livin' life, I'm lovin' life, you hatin' every second
I've noticed you've been on my new white shoes since i stepped it, get to steppin'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah

Take his ass straight to a hospital


I'm screamin' dolla dolla bill yo
Pistol in the air route my mama's back window
Drugs never say no, fucks never gave those
Cops on my payroll, I'm all about the bank row
Never does a day go by where I ain't flow
Mind like an eight ball, spit like 8 flows
You pop like faygo, I'm raw like quay loose
Stole the beat of me and watch me hit it like Babe Ruth, hit it like Jay Dupe, blunts poppin' garbage bag
Young cardiac, catch a fuckin' heart attack
Now my heart attack, I am never leavin' rap
Leave my blunt at home, baby I'll be right back
Yea it's like that, get high as nuts rollin' another then we light that


You think it's a game, you think it's a game


I'm feelin' like Jordan in the 93 playoffs
Hit the fuckin' jump shot then I fuckin' lay up
Do it for the team throwin' up the middle finger
Fuck you if you love us, love if you hate us
Too much makeup, pockets too caked up
Walk with the gangster lean I tell 'em drink up
Fresh up out the water just a young fuckin' sea punk
Blunts by the seashore couldn't give a sea fuck
#

Ok I'm cruisin' in my bucket seat, comfortably, bitch fuck with me
A billion for the watch, that's nothin' I'm livin' comfortably
Never ballin' on a bugetsy I'm in the lap of luxury
Marble refrigerators in my 3D navigator
Pop the trunk just for the haters, let em see us let em hate
Cuz I just love bein' a pimp, I won't let that go to waste
Got that banger on my waist
If you tryna get in my face with all that shit, fuck off bitch I'm bouta split I'm bouta dip I'm bouta parlay


You know what you like dont waste no time
Be mine if you like the way i parlay tonight we can make it right thats fine if you like the way i parlay you're fine i wanna make you mine if its time baby we can really parlay tonight i can blow your mind (i know you) i know you like the way i parlay
#
I'm on a journey like I just left Pallet Town
Young Ash Ketchum, snapback flipped around
Cause I'm ready to battle anyone in my path'll
Get hydro pumped and fire blasted
You are just trainer, me I am the master
My flow is so elite four, like gate badges
They say the beauty pageant, but if it ever was
It's safe to say that I've already won
See I've already done everything that you doing
I've already thought every thought that is brewing inside your little brain
Thoughts of mixtape names
Which one should you choose, stop just watch me
I can show you how to take your dreams and catch 'em all
No nets, no traps, no master balls
I could show you how to rule the world with one flow
But first I just wanna make sure you know that

You're not like me, I'm not like you
You probably hate me, I probably hate you too
You don't know me and I don't know you but
If I were you I'd probably hate me too

Fresh from uh Professor Oak's house, I just got my fuckin' starter
I just fuckin' whooped Gary's dumb ass
#

Up late in my better way, starin' at my ceiling fan goin' round and round like life on a grander scale
I put it down, you barely put new shit up
21 mixtapes and I ain't even close to done
Ride with the system up, never really gave a fuck
Put a blunt into the atmosphere and watch it burn up
I was 7 in my room with a mic and a boom box
Blocks hot, non stop, rhyme until the sun drops
#
I'm feeling this shit
I'm killin' this shit
I'm 17 and I can't believe I'm killin' this shit
I put it down, for the Team that's SESH
[?], black heart in my chest
It's curtains, I'm goin' hard
I'm makin' racket
Don't give a fuck if you're not likin' how I'm actin'
You're not diggin' how I'm rappin'
I'll be joking, you're not laughin'
I'm Th@ Kid, quit school and really did this rap shit
Christmas, light on
Mic with the light on
Red light, record, Kid goes, beast mode
All my friends back home, just can't believe they rise
Is he still doing this rap shit? Not a surpise
Cause they know, that it's in me
And they know, this has been me
Since the first day in the basement
Kickin' rap shit till the sun drops
Nigh falls, night calls tanqueray and sprite up
Night in the garage Red smoke eye
The echo of everything I used to know
#

We're gathered here today
Not to mourn, but to celebrate
Ashes to ashes
Blunts to blunts
SESH


All black Glock 10 locked in the cockpit
Windows up white punk guttin' blunts
It's t-h-@ sign BT if flatline
Dip that cell gate and the flow will give 'em flat ties
Never got rat ties
Shit is just a satire
Never been to church what the fuck is a rabbi
Been the kid since 13, I always hate to say I'm that guy
Get that high speak mad rhymes you gotta heavy flow that's a fat lie
I can picture you when you write
Play a beat, say some things
And write 'em down like that rhymes
You a fuckin' joke like hehe
Lol, brb, gotta kill the blunt, RIP
Ash to ash
Blunt to blunt
People live to sesh
I sesh to love huh

Robert Davis, in my system
I turn it up and then I can feel him
Robert Davis, in my switcher
I take a hit and I can feel it
Never goin' down, always comin' up
And Don't ask what's up cuz I get what's up
Don't ask what's good, the answers me
And don't ask who I'm with, I'm with the team
I'm guttin' blunts, I'm cuttin' trees
Young lumberjack with the rolled up sleeves
Rolled up jeans blowin' rolled up leaves
Ashin' out the window to the cold cut breeze
Cold cut team with the cold cut dream
NIP till I RIP
Please, believe me, I been killin' these beats and bury them in a burial underneath the streets
Under my [?] in the bleachers I never see ya waitin' near the rejack
When we went outlaw, like road dog, and we were bad boys like DX
Throw an XD and then suck it
See we don't give a fuck we say fuck it
Fuck that and fuck Dave get ripped away but get out the way
#

I'm mad you up all night
Layin' on your back with your legs in the air
I'm mad you up all night
Kissin' on the neck then she whisper in my ear say
Go, go, fast as you can
She pullin' on the sheets while I'm pullin' on her hair
And I ain't lettin' ya go but if you need a rest baby let me know
Whoooooaaaaa goin' through the motions
Up all night goin' deep as the oceans
Say lemme hear you scream
Put your face to the pillow lemme give you what you need to be up all night and
Fuckin' till the morning light
Lemme hear you scream whoa
Say ohhhhhohhhhhhohhhhhwhooooaaoaaoa
Up all night

Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you

Ski mask and a Glock
Run up in your spot
My parents taught me well so where the fuck did I go wrong
What the fuck I got to lose
Shoot 'em up that's kinda rude
Rather smoke a blunt and kick a rap but what am I gonna do
I'ma stick 'em up quick and the ricochet doesn't hit a man down shots fired now I'm runnin' through the kitchen
Bookin' it through the garden sorry bitch I beg your pardon
Killin' all your daffodils and kickin' up all your flowers
I put it down for the kids who fuckin' can't
The kids who hate school but parents won't let 'em fail
Tell 'em I say fuck you and everything that they believe
That's rude as shit but that's just me if you don't like it leave
I got some tricks right here up my fuckin' sleeve
Mask-like Halloween
Automatic weapons under my bed just tryna sleep
Let it leap up out the sheets
Rip some holes in your knees
Now you goin' out like Tony face down in the deep

Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the
Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you

Basement life
Christmas lights
Gin with Sprite
Wine on ice
Short list of the things that I like
It's funny how drunk nights describe life
Feel my lines
Hear my rhymes
Recycling bottles, we on the wintertime grind
Savin' up bucks to get wintertime drunk
Phones on silent, lets have fun

Run in garage
Chillin' in the rush
Ice was gone
Somebody run to the store
Get a big thing of cubes and a six pack of Dew, see we do real big
I wish you'd get a clue
Just teenagers, sub woof bangin'
Cops knock on the door, quiet 'till they leavin'
Now turn it up, that all the neighbors hearin'
Pals started talkin', the girls started hearin'
The ways that the young do That's party all the time first week day two
Sixtel new, get up that Dew
Whatever we did last night, times two
Skip school, act foolish like kids do
Run 'em up through town then go back to
The basement, come and stay the night
I'd like to welcome y'all to the times of my life

I ain't losin' friends, but I be losing sleep
In the garage at night screamin' lyrics to that shit
[?], pouring out my soul, trying to balance my composure, but I can't do it alone
I need my gang with me
I see what things'll be
For the dope-ass kids from scrap nation
From off the [?], turn it back again
I need some space
I say, I need some time
I got my foot in the door, and I got money on my mind
Because I, I'm steady racin' in the marathon
I'm steady, pushin' my way off the bar
I'm steady, dreaming, oh I'm steady dreamin'
I can show everybody what I be California Dreamin'

I came from the basement, grew up in the basement
Tanqueray on shallow days, feelin' like we made it
I be in the basement
I wish that you could face it
The picture's out of focus, but the image never fading

See, y'all trying to do what we already done
So no matter what, you just a re-run
Yo, click rewind, hit me twice, we can settle what you said, you ain't consider me tight
I'm a K2-kid on my K2-shit
Take me into your lungs, I'ma let loose bitch with the loose cannons
Runnin' town like errands
When we shot at, we shot back like Terrance
We was the ones that made the past
Gave a [?] the liter and guess who was dead last
Y'all was in the bag, who was first class?
When I see [?], half full glass
But you was still mad, plannin' your attack
Made 'cause we had somethin' you'll never have
Tally, creativity, just imaginin' a world without us is like ones without the magic
Stars, planets, worlds collide
Then the red lights on and the Kid goes live
Time flies when you truly alive
I'd like to welcome y'all to the times of my life


I came from the basement, grew up in the basement
Tanqueray on shallow days, feelin' like we made it
I be in the basement
I wish that you could face it
The picture's out of focus, but the image never fading
Welcome to the basement
[?] with the basement
Welcome to the basement
I'm feelin' like we made it
Welcome to the basement

Sometimes it's so hard to be so famous
I mean I'm so famous

I'm famous, famous, bitch I'm famous
Cameras flashin', females faintin'
Famous, famous, bitch I'm famous
Got a lot of money so I gotta go spend it

Ridin' 'round the city like a big shot
In a shirt I've found at the thrift shop
Fuck hip-hop, let the fuckin' kid rock
Wrist watch, tick-tock, 2, 1, lift off
I've waited my whole fuckin' life to be where I am tonight
In the Hollywood Hills ownin' hundred dollar bills
Passin' out, wakin' up and catchin' flights
Money in my hand, I'm 'bout to throw it all
Ounce in the bag and I'm 'bout to blow it all
Hardcore flow, smackdown vs raw
Tabloids gossip, blunts get sparked
Everybody knows I'm the fuckin' kid
Dropped outta school then I fuckin' got rich
Somethin' always lit, turned up, let me spit
The bass goes bang and the lighter goes flick

I'm famous, famous, bitch I'm famous
Cameras flashin', females faintin'
Famous, famous, bitch I'm famous
Got a lot of money so I gotta go spend it

Gateway drugs gateway blunt
Blowin' smoke and catch a gateway bus
Get crunk while I'm rollin' up
Young Lil John, high up
Gateway drugs in my cup
Gateway drugs in my blunt
I got the key in my hand and my key in the gate and I'm bout to open up like
Open sesame
Rescue me from my destiny
What's left of me is a recipe of Mountain Dew and phetamines
Flows sick, definitely
Cool as shit, yes sir-ee
Puttin' it down 'till I'm down in the ground a hundred years from now and you won't remember me
Friend of me, enemy, either way dead to me
Tires they blow, pedals keep pedaling
Wheelie keep turning, blunts keep on burning
Cadillac swerving, bangin' the curbs
Young dumbfuck with a blunt full of herb
Lessons I've learned, bridges I've burned
Dues that I've paid, tables I've turned
Fuck that noise I got money to earn
Fuck is up?
Puttin' it down 'till your bitch pick it up
Bitch that's enough I wind up in the trunk
One on the trigger and one on the Glock
Servin' the fiends up on the block
Bitch I rhyme, but bitch I rap
They can lie, then so can I yuh

Pop In Your Grey Cassette
Turn Up Your Fuckin' Deck
Lend Me Your Ear Because The Southside Finna Wreck

Bass clappin' like a Mac-10
Automatic weapons
The only way that I can paint a picture for my reverends
Ain't nobody get me, I'm feelin' like an orphan
Endorphins swimmin' through my veins like dolphins
Used to dream all this, from writin' to recordings
To boardin' flights every night now that we tourin'
I've never paid the mortgage so I guess it's fuckin' time to
Get high, get paid it's just what I was designed to do
Comin' down, switchin' lanes, just how I was taught
From the rappers that came before me in them candy painted cars
No, I ain't got a license but I got a fuckin' bike
Big ole blunt, dead of the night, 4 a.m lets take a ride
Lets get high, lets get high
Pedal slow, pedal slow
Up the block around the corner to the store, to the store
I got 5 dollars in quarters and Ima let it go two [?] and two cigarillos

I'm never comin' down comin' comin' comin' down never
Comin' down comin' comin' comin' down never

That shit foolish
Gimme two wheels and a seat I'm cool with it
So Joe cool with it, lay back chill type
Dark ass shades Johnny cage ain't this nice

Got money on my mind like Weezy
Rock dark ass frames like Eazy
Flow radder like Master P
Team SESH be an army, B. Geezy
I'm really real but I ain't gotta say it
If you gotta hose you ain't gotta spray it
You know I rock this bitch like Amadeus
And I'm here all day, shit, nobody could save ya

Money in the bath

A million dollars on the line you know I'm never phonin'
You motherfucker getting gloom motherfucker

You know we SESH when you smell us

I be at the thrift shop if you need to find me
2 fools gold chains matchin' like siamese
5 dollar shirt and a 7 dollar time piece
Time just flies when you livin' like I be
I be at the thrift shop lookin' for a wrist watch
Somethin' from the 30's, if not it's just pish posh
Lookin' for that vintage
Flow old fashion
Old briefcase for the times that I'm travelin'
No backpackin', just knapsackin'
Young dumbfuck in the back blunt wrappin'
Team so dapper, kid so sharp
Camera adores me, young Robert Culp

I'm lookin' like the man and I'm feelin' like it too
In my thrift shop rags fuck your hundred dollar shoes
I'm lookin' like the man and I'm feelin' like it too
In my thrift shop rags fuck your hundred dollar suit

I be at the thrift shop if you need to find me
2 fools gold chains matchin' like siamese

Smoking is bad for your health

I'm so ahead of the times
Young daylight savings with a fetish for rhymes
I'm up while you recline
You rise but bitch I shine
I shine like a starry night
Sharper than the end of my knife
I've got a switchblade in my sock
Bikin' up the block
Dope in my system
Checking my mirror for cops
If drugs kill, I am death
No fear, no respect
Sea cress on my white skin
Young Turk with my rhymin'
Father time with my timin'
My timin' so timeless
Your time is, never bitch
My shits forever its classic
So classy but my pocketwatch
Team Sesh written on the top
Scholar shoes never collars pop
Gold cufflinks, young white fuck
I don't kill beats, I surf 'em
My flow, you could never learn it
My earnings, you could never earn 'em
The blunts I smoke man
You could never burn 'em
The team I walk with
You could never run with
Flights so good and the sun so sunny
Fuck a hobby this is life
Since the age of fuckin' 9
Baller blockin' in my headphones
Dollar signs all in my mind
Blame it on Master P for gettin' this flow so nice
#

Ohhhh time and time and time again
You've really been my only friend
Little did you know little did you know
You wanna die like gravity
Walking fucking travesty
Out the fucking back with me
I hope I never have to let her go
I hope I never have to let you go
#
Trippin', listen', the mind is like a gift it's
Golden like Egyptian my scriptures are [?] my addictions are simple but alone harder than nickle. I drown my lungs in blunt smoke
And make noises into a microphone and y'all love it
Or hate it, whatever I still made it; still got high and hit record
Waking up and getting faded when I say the word SESH you
Better know it's how I'm living waking up to just to get the feeling of those instrumentations; that shit's amazing

18 fucking years old, I can't believe I'm this cold, I'm this crack
I'm this dope, I'm this coke, I flip the toast
I burn one for the night rats roll one for the bite back roll another for the next sesh and roll another blunt for after that
Just a aftermath in my habitat. Blunt smoke in cash wraps; cash that then I pack that you ask last 'cause you ash last 'cause no we don't have a problem with passing we only ask that you ash it in the tray and not on the mattress, keep it classy
So classic

Howell's favorite asshole
Live from the backroads
Can’t say that you dig this shit
Hit [?] on the ride home
So nice on this microphone
Y'all don't even fucking know
But they say I’m bipolar
The way I'm so cold with these fuckin' flows
Flows, I got a pocket full
You trippin' like you got a [knot] in y'all
Y'all should've saw your face when you heard
Th@ Kid knockin' at your fuckin’ door
Bang Bang, who is it?
Skinny kid, looks boolemic
I admit it, I been spittin’
Out these rhymes
Since I was an infant
I'm a scholar, you’re a peasant
YoungDumbFuck get it trough your head that
It's the team, oh it's the team
In the dug out, gettin' faded
Rap out real in, you just fake it
Talk that money like you already made it
Kid just stop it
You don’t got it
Like a pass down to the basement
You can't come here
You ain't from here
I promise you've never been
Down D-19 at 4am
In and out of consciousness
Too much smoke
Too much drink
Tangerade bottle in the kitchen sink
We all drunk
We all fucked up
We can't think
We can't speak
But we can live, we can breathe
We're gonna take more damn drinks
Walk across the streets to your mom's house
Take whatever she got in that damn fridge
Too young, too blind
Lookin' at life trough high eyes
Eyelids down, middle finger's up
May the 517 please stand up

This remind me of winter time when I was back home
In the car full of smoke, back road full of snow
No chains on the tires, so for now drive slow
Its only, 3 am, the blunts getting rolled
From D-19 up to Latson Road, drive slow, burn slow
To the kids back home working fingers to the bones
Saving up all week just to blow it on a bowl, burn slow
Burn slow, drive slow, burn slow

Yeah, Sesh, yeah, Sesh
#
They can't believe I'm not famous yet
Sicker than their favorites
I'm comin' so raw
Go fuck with them if you want safer sex
It's safe to say I'm fucking next
Blunts to the fucking neck
Team at yo fuckin' neck
On to the fucking next
Next on my bucket list
I will now run this shit
Lap after lap
Till they out of breathe and bucket kick
Raps is what I'm fucking kickin'
SESH is what I fuckin' live
If you ain't snackin' what I'm bagging
You can eat a fucking dick

Wanna hear me kill a beat ?
Open up your fuckin' ears
Rewind this shit
Listen close
'Cause I just fuckin' did

They can't get enough of me
And I can't get enough of them
And those who talkin' shit
You make me blush but now I'm flushin' ya
Flushin' ya
Down the drain
Fuck with me ?
Not today
'Cause I'm with the team
And the team with me
It's like a junkyard dog with no leash
We up the chain
Not the same
Red eyes
Benstein
No sleep but I still dream 'bout goldchains
And black rides
'Bout gold teeth and fat tires
Grab some blunts
Double-wide
So we can get there by tonight
The way that J [?] drives
If this life is a film, I'm the kid who don't rehearse
If this life is a test, I'm the kid who don't work
I be rappin' like the best
'Cause it's all I've ever earned
So if fame is a sentence I deserve every word

This is dedicated
To all the middle aged people
That buy bikes 'cause they wanna go fast
Loosin' a little hair
Goin' to the SharkClub on fridays
Playin' a little billiard, havin' some beers
Hey fuck it we're dads, you know
Good dads

Life without love, love without drugs
Drugs without blunts, blunts without guts
Me without the team, the team without me
Me without rap, rap without me
Me without the rats, rats without the pack
Off with these peasants heads, onto the next
Life,Sex,Breath,Sesh, that's how I live my days 'till I'm dead
And I can't, 'till I'm gone, 'till I'm banished
I'ma kick it then replenish, all these raps for these rats
Fuck time we some Jerries, the paper and the fetti
Fuck the cheese and the dairy, fuck the change
Fuck the green, fuck you if you don't get it
I don't do it for the money, never change for some money
Came in with the team, I'm not 'bout to leave without 'em
I'll come, I'm still starred and labeled with these rappers
I'm a kid kicking raps, they are choreographed actors
Ochobot transformed to the best, no opinion just fact
They beast, I am that, old soul, old flow, with a pipe from the 20's
Feeling like Sinatra, it's been a very good year for me
Young Frank, fresh out the golden age
Summer winter I came down then I blew away
Now, I'm with the team out in outer space
Blowing nebulas, blunt full of galaxies

I'm so outta here, this high shot me to the stratosphere
Click clack, bang bang, slow mo
Getting ported to the galaxy, look out below
Oh, I get so high, I, I'm scared to look down
I ain't ever looking down, I ain't ever looking down
I get so high, I, I ain't ever looking down
I ain't ever looking down, I ain't ever looking down

Call ya dealer, get some weed, text your friend who's 23
Tell him we got 20 bones if he bring over what he need
A fifth of Tanqueray, an eigth of AK
I know that cost extra but to me that ain't a thang
'Cause I just got my check, yeah I just got paid
And its Friday so you know what that mean
Let's take it down to the basement, bottle to the face shit
Parents gone, no time to waste, hurry up lets get wasted
I'm homesick, I taste it, when I mix that Tanq with that
Gatorade, that generate, that take me to Jane shit
Pictures, they faded, its midnight, we faded
Night rats AKA the kids you used to hate bitch

Yellin' NRZ, 'till I R-I-P, y'all gonn' envy me, yeah
Young MVP, 'till I R-I-P, y'all gonn' envy me

Met a girl, her name was Audrey, so French but she ain't foreign
First time she came over, had her looking like a DeLorean
Her hands up, my music loud, my first fan, my first crowd
That's when I was positive, I was gonna be the best rapper out and boom
Look what happened now, I'm the fucking best rapper out
If it ain't TeamSesh or Th@ Kid, you know I don't ever bump it loud
Fuck I'll bump this loud, bring the fucking house down
I do this shit for Lucky Strike, all the way up to Uptown
Bitch you know the rundown

Yellin' NRZ, 'till I R-I-P, y'all gonn' envy me, yeah

Yo, look

This that early morning yawnin', haven't slept now or tommorow
But for now just keep that bottle slowly hollowin' and swallow that
Tanqueray and Sprite, feel like 'Pac in '95
All I need is some enemies and a tat' to say thug life
Never lived a rough life, only lived that rat life
Blunt night lights on down as that sun rise
Night rats you already know how we ride
In the pack, let's just sesh, we don't wanna fight
Just light, it's alright

They tell me, um
Lately, you've been getting too high, that's a lie
There ain't such thing as too high
Lately, I've been getting too high, that's a lie
There ain't such thing as too high
I'm just a kid, that like to rhyme
And, its my time

Sesh, night rats
If you don't dig it then you don't get it, fuck you
#
They got the rise to the skyline, talking to the skylight
God hope you listenin', like I hope you get this
They write letters to the galaxy, tear 'em up and throw them in the breeze
I hope you get this, like God I hope you listenin'
But I refuse to believe in, everything they believe in
I guess I just don't need it, why? 'Cause I just can't believe it
'Cause I just can't believe it, yeah
#

Yo, I moved out from my parents house, only 16
Badda boom badda bing then I hit the scene
I wrote raps for a minute, 'cause fuck it I've always been
Considered something of a fuck up since the age of 10
Making scene throwing tantrums, putting mom in bad moods
Pissing off my father I would scream when we'd argue
Still can't believe that I came this far
From barely kicking in the basement to be kicking it hard, yeah
But still kicking it raw, no effects just echoes just to set the scene dark, yeah
And still kicking it strong, and I'ma kick it 'till I by the fall
So long
Yeah, au revoir, so long, and I'ma kick it 'till my times over
Yeah, au revoir, so long, kicking raps, evading traps night rat soldier

Lemme simmer down, lemme simmer down, ay
Lemme simmer down, lemme simmer down

Best friends turn old friends, faster than the world spins
Try to work it out for what its worth but its worthless
I wish somebody could have told me at the start
Of this so called friendship, it'd soon flip dark
It'd soon be gone, water under the dock
Voicemails missed calls better keeping in touch
Days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months
If we were back in the basement, that wouldn't be us
But now it is, so I guess that's a reality check
I cashed that bitch almost a year ago, it just bounced back, yeah
And here come the flashbacks, Chi-town, H-town, backyard wrestlin'
It used to be ECD in this bitch but now
It's just the E, the rest I ain't seen since, yeah

Lemme simmer down, lemme simmer down, ay
Lemme simmer down, lemme simmer down

Back roads, dirt roads
Babitha, if you're listening, thank you
If you're not, fuck you

Yeah

Gig in the hard drive, its T-H, @ sign, K-I-D, yeah that's right
Act so, scholar like, old fashioned borad, Scarlett life
I'm going hard 'cause I can't go home
Howell's a place that I cannot go
'Cause I ain't blown yet and I ain't known yet
But I'ma work that out, like Bowflex
Fuck a Rolex, and a sports car
Put me in the back of that black Ford, with the big blunt

I'm weed, I'm throwed, I'm cigarette smoke
I'm syrup, I'm full of that high fructose

I'm shrooms, I'm tripping, I said that you didn't
I'm on that shit that got your skin itchin'
The bass in your system, the dick in your sister
The neighborhood kid that ding dong ditch you
That Kid, puts the sick in the sickness
I'm kicking these raps till they show up on the Richter
Feel it in your city every time that I kick one
Run for the hills or your mother's gonna miss you
I am the realest. You? You are the fakest
She? She come with me but with you she just fake it
Bullshit just say I just don't got time
Skinny jeans, gold chain, with my nose to the grind

I'm young, I'm real, I'm cool, I'm trill
I'm potent, I'm holdin', I'm the first how it feel?
I'm the midnight chill, I'm the sunset shine
You're loose, I'm tight like your fuckin' first time
Like fucking your first time
Blood red eyes, inhale, exhale, smoke white like I
Fly for a white guy, too high for life
Half naked in the day, fully naked by night
Blow tree love life, go and smoke you some right
Least vibe to the shit like you do tonight
Rap tag team $E$H that's the sound I like
Light it, flick it; Rap kickin' night rat till I die

I'm sick, I'm dope, I'm speed, I'm coke
I'm crack; I be everything your parents said don't
I'm weed, I'm throwed, I'm cigarette smoke
I'm syrup, I'm full of that high fructose
I'm sick, I'm dope, I'm speed, I'm coke
I'm crack; I be everything your parents said don't
I'm weed, I'm throwed, I'm cigarette smoke
I'm syrup, I'm full of that high fructose
#
Whe-en I-i ge-et low
Ohoo I get high

Uhh
Bike ride and a picnic
That's how you'd spend your days if you were this kid
If you were this sick
If you were this dope
Flow ballistic, girl blowin' o's
Blond hair runnin' all down her back
Pink lipstick with a black backpack
Just a no fashion gal with no fashion acts
Sippin' ginger ale out of champagne glass
[?] body with an actress face
With some blackhole eyes that would suck you in
Got a big dip of smile and some milky way skin
Her hearth's a galaxy that I wanna be in

Straight up divin'
And fuck it just thrivin'
If I'm myself a jungle and swing vine to vine
Fuck them
Tar-zan
Got the team with me and we spark 'em

When I get home
Ohoo I get high

My man walked out
Now you know that ain't right
Well he better watch out
If I meet him tonight
I said
When I get home
Ohoo I get high

I get high (x3)
Ohoo I get high
I get high (x2)
#
Yeah
Wipin' clouds out my eyes
I'm back up on the high that puts the clouds in the skies
Can't put this high in rewind
So after you hit it just hold on for the ride, it goes
Up and down
Mary go 'round
Wether you're down or not just pass Mary around
Let the whole team hit it
Sesh I've been with it
Gold chain, white skin, black hair and some dimples
Just a kid with the world in my right
And the swisher in the left somebody give me a light
Young franklin, like I'm outside with a kite
And a key to a door that leads to a new life
Sugar and spice, and everything nice
A little money, fast cars and a little bit of ice
But I'm not trynna get any of that
Just a house for my parents and a stage to rap
#
"Dave is passed out right now
Whatever you say man, we clashed"

I was born in a wrap
Simple as that
Now I gut blunts
[?] [?] bags in class
In the back of that class
I would rap
But it'd be trash
That was back when I was failin'
I was safe to say I passed
For the best in town
Fuckin' best in state
Seventeen
Kickin' raps that would fuck your brain
Talkin' 'bout gold chains, gold teeth and rings
Singin' Cash Money Records' an army like BG
Fuck a shinny new car
I'm ashin' the tank
No limit on the break lights
No limit on my chain
These are real rhymes
Driven by real faith in this game
To let me bring the thing to life again

Cartier's big tints and some baggy ass jeans, yeah
I'm lost in the 90's
Go back in time if you really wanna find me
'Cause I'm lost in the 90's
And there's no tellin' when I'll be back
I'm with Master P
Blowin' weed in his lap
'Cause I'm lost in the 90's
And there's no tellin' when I'll be back

Pullin' on the corner with my touchscreen phone
You can tell that Hollywood is my home
Spice 1 in my headphones
Skatin' up to Melrose
TeamSESH lighter, flick flame
Young hellboys
Young rick, blowin' up shit
'Cause everytime I drop a rap
I just blew up the kid
Puttin' bank in my piggy
'Cause I owe all this
To the ones that raised me
Yeah my family n' shit
My brother n' shit
My cousins n' shit
Well not really my cousins
But I'll give Dave a little bit
And Jay a little bit
Just to buy some new fish
So we can get high and laugh
When they battle n' shit
Battle n' ships
N' sinkin' every one of 'em
TeamSESH roach rats
Masters we on somethin'
On nothin', that's you
Fuck you, fuck you
Too high, too young
My blunts too full

"You talk weed alot ?"
-Yes I do
"Why do you do that ?"
-'Cause that's just what I do
"Are you tryin' to appeal or just trynna sound cool ?"
-Well now I'm gettin' high just to fuckin' forget you

(Dave is fuckin' passed out)
#
Yeah
Reporting live from the Sewer
Th@ Kid, RatPack, SESH

Hand me down hoodie with a no gold chain on
Feeling like DMC back in A4
Hat turned back, kid pushing on my skateboard
Cream colour sneakers
Life is a cake-walk
Once again backs the incredible
Here to bring the world some noise
So get ready for
My racket, smash it
Put it in the trash can
Other dudes acting
Me I'm just rapping
All these jack-rabbits, thinking I'm in last place
I just broke the ribbon at the finish of this rat race
Your far too kind, Thank you all
A special thanks to my friends who thought they knew it all
Scratch that, I meant to say "old friends"
It's at the point in life to where hope it was just hopeless
Got sick of smoking, got tired of drinking
So I closed my eyes, till I woke to freedom
On the five speeding, shifting gears and spitting frees
Till I got back to LA, and sparked with the team
It's the young hitter, "batter ups" what they screaming
Cause every rap that I kicks is as good as my last hit
#
Everyday I dress my ass off
Sharper than some cat paws
Never leave my house without some change from the cash drawer
Trynna get the cash vault
Kickin' all these raps out
When i rap I'm dead ass
These rappers just ass out
I pack loud ash clouds all over my room
Too high, too young and the blunts too full
Skinny jeans, no shirt
Find me howling at the moon
Call me young Micheal J, teenage werewolf
A teenage werewolf
You said that you were eatin' but I'm feastin', where you?
Seventeen, coolest motherfucker out, how you do?
With the tip of my hat and the tap of my shoe
Fuck you
So scholar-like Don't know what tomorrow brings so welcome it with open wings
There's not a person that can tell you what the future holds
So don't fuck it up, remember life is fragile
But it's too late, I'm on a roll
High with my friends trynna get that on a row (x2)
#
"Hahah you look like the weirdest fuckin' people"

Now I'm almost fameless
Fuck a record label
Rather remain nameless
Flow stainless
Others just rusty
So I'm spittin' WD-40
I smoke weed with my buddies and love it
We got that TeamSESH bumpin'
I ain't gotta tell you how he does this
You arleady know the kid fuckin' does this
//
I lick a wrap, kick a rap then I light it
Clouds too opaque then blame it on my lighter
Butane kit let me loose n' i light up
Screamin' "FUCK Dave !" till the day I fuckin' die out
N' oceans dry out n' clouds rain fire
N' my reign of power is remebered like the titans
It'll be so tight, when
I'm kickin' raps in stadiums, huh
//
Young Ferris Bueller
Motherfuck a tutor
Cut class, gut blunts
That's what we do, yuh
That's what I did
Never had to fuck to get
Sorry if I'm comin' on too strong
I'm th@ Kid
That shit, that piss
Or whatever rappers say
See I'm too cool for slang
N' I'm too hot for cable
Too hard for TV, too good for radio
Get the fuck about my earlobes with what you're sayin' y'all
#
Yeah, I'm fading in and out a day dream
I start thinking 'bout life, ice and bright things
Thick gold ropes, rose gold Rollies
Feeling funky [?] ivory what the fuck's he pulling?
But, that's just me, I get it from my pops
Growing up around Motown sound can teach a lot
Gotta feel it in your soul if your tryna make it art
Can't pay without pape', can't love without a heart
Gotta put your all in it, put your time in it
Can't sit back and wait for your time, you gotta get it
Tryna live it than live it, if your not get with it
And if you can't get with it, then you ain't getting shit
Yeah, yeah
And if you don't get that, then you'll never get it
Yeah, uh
The night, it's dark, the blunt, it spark
Ash falling off the end, brain catching thoughts
Old pimp shit playing on my speaker box
Passing J's back and forth, front seat to back yeah

You can get it if you wanted to, you can get it if you wanted to
Gotta do whatchu gotta do, gotta wanna do whatchu do
'Cause you know nothing gets accomplished if you don't move
Every move, I guess they could really feel you if they wanted to
Just know they never really felt you from the start, yeah
Contemplations, I can see it in your eyes
Did you really wanna get there, or did you wanna just join the ride?
Contemplations, I can see it in your eyes
Did you really wanna get there, or did you wanna just join the ride?

Yeah, yeah, ay, ay
#
Turn the lights down, just vibe to this shit
You ain't gotta send respect, just pay mind to this shit

I'm feeling like I'm on to some shit with every beat that I rip, with every lyric that I spit
The young kid's getting it; a legend in the making
But what makes a legend legendary if you're fucking faking it
Easy rather taking it, the shoes are looking vacant
So Im climbing power lines just to see if I can fit in 'em
I ain't got stripes to earn and pass the rituals
Shit is just a bitchual by now, I thought you knew
I thought you knew
The kid at school that you thought you knew
I thought you knew
The kid at school that you thought you knew
#
Yeah

When we were young we'd always talk about gettin' outta town
Now I'm a little older and just look at me now
I got El
While they just remain slaves to gravity
I'm tryna' be the first star, from another galaxy
Astronomy, looking out the sun roof, pondering
The blunt gets passed to me flaming like Calgary
I gotta take the hit before it goes out
My lungs filled with smoke I blow a couple o's out
Over to my girl now, shot-gunning the dope
Call it X's and O's the way we tic-tac smoke
It's a cats game for you pussies when I ain't tryin
Cause it's meaner to get them thinking that they coulda' won it
But that ain't nothin', cause I am the bully of this hallway
The duke of the depths
The king of the rats
So I'm always, reppin'
If the cats start steppin'
Throw a night rats salute
To show them in the veteran
I don't give a fuck, it's apparent by my raps
Find me with the team, that's the SESH rap-pack
Back seats smoking
Seat flat back
Old fashion life, smoke white, lungs black
AttaBoy
#
"Yeah..
Fuck, this one's for the rats..
Hmphm, yeah"

Turn it up !
Go wake your neighbors
And tell 'em if they want it down
They gon' have to make us
We teenagers, Young troublemakers
You wanna start off on a new page then page us
'Cause I ain't callin' you
No I ain't botherin'
I'd rather cooperate with this blunt 'till I can't operate
And walls start to oscillate
Come on man concentrate
I know the room spinnin' but you gotta keep it scholarly
Like Socrates, all about philosophy
So when I say I'm chillin' I mean kickin' it like soccer teams

Honestly
Who fuckin' standing next to me
Skinny dude, no shirt, goldchain, tiny jeans
And these are just a couple things, yeah

'Cause you can't take the rest of me
They raps are I got the game's recipe
So they be picking through my garden
Lookin' for the best of beats
They thought that THAT was the best of me
The day they get the best from me is when I'm droppin' CD's
Compact Disks, and in store signings
Tell 'em barricade the sidewalk in case any violence
Breaks out like children cryin', "oh, mine" whining
Put the pacifier back in, tell 'em fucking track in
I don't fuck around nor ever am I beating
I get straight to the point like winnings on tv
"Bob what we got for 'em ?
A brand new flat screen"

(very subtle off voice)
And a trip to uh..
Jamaica
#
It's the young freeloader, crashing on your sofa
Woke up, pissed off, where's all the soda?
Well I assume, see the cans by my feet
The bag of chips on my lap, the bag you said don't eat
Well, let's just say I didn't listen
Let's just say that I'm really starting to piss ya
Off, "Off with his head" playing in your cranium
I'm looking at you crazy but you looking at me crazier
I bet I'm starting to get on ya nerves, huh?
I bet you starting to run out of the words, huh?
I bet you start it, yeah, but I bet I end it
Throw myself on the pavement, claim that you did it
I'm the kid, and motherfucker I am it
Go fish, that's a go figure
I see you pull my card, you know what I'm the king of
Night rats, I write raps, when night flash, they go from tiptoe
To "I'll be right back"
I'm the kid, and motherfucker I am it, yeah, yeah
#
"Huuuh
I gotta pee.."

Uhhm
High as fucking shit
Outta control, outta it
Ounce and a half going to your grandma'
Still rollin' trash stuff and Music blast, we get stupid
Tobacco and ash
Please allow me to do this
Then go and get stranded
Where all the planes is landin'
Pass it till they can't hit
Smoke weed get naked

Then I gotta take ya
To a place that I can't take ya

Wake up get faded
Go to work still faded
Come home get faded
Go to sleep still faded
Wake up get faded
Go to work still faded
Come home get faded
Go to sleep faded
Wake up get faded

Smoke weed, end up naked

"Hey man, huh, does that go hard?
Hard, hey man, it need to go haard"

Th@Kid : "Yeah this is second take i'll admit it, fuck off, sue me! cocksucker !"
"I fuckin' ran out of breath"

Used to cut class and gut blunts
Never gave a fuck 'cause i'm fuckless
Now I'm burnin' weed and bumbin' glasses
You can say that I'm toasted, I'm toastin'
To the team success
Ain't even been a year and the kid's the best
I'm seventeen, you thirty somethin'
Numbers don't lie now tell me something
What's the real reason I ain't blown up yet ?
Am I not basic enough
For you peasants to understand
I'm the man, I'm the many
You can never tell me different
I'm so different from the di-fe-rent
The difference is I kick it
All these raps that I rap ain't inspired by the present
This is 1997, fuckin' No limit records
I'm so 'bout it, 'bout it
I know my parents gonna hate this
"Huhhu What's up mom
Hey dad !  Danny !

You into vanity, looking for some parody
Getting dolled up, trying not to be a parody
The bare minimum's your bare minerals
Some [?] in yo sink, now you looking like a centerfold
Something straight out of magazine or a movie
And you dress to kill too, please, just don't shoot me
Just choose me, let me be your two feet
Walk on over to me and tell me what your mood be
NYX and YSL, printed on your lipstick too, but I can't tell
Goddamn, you ain't gotta buy it all
You barely got a job so why you buying the mall
But I get it, you cute and that dress is too
I just wish you didn't let the brand names brand you
Feeling so brand new, but if you gonna need me then I'ma need you
To be you, I need you
If you gonna need me then I'ma need you
#
My mind's a weapon
My mouth is too
My flow is semi-automatic on wax so rude
I, I get in the zone
Then I make it happen
Just a kid with a passion for rapping
I get in the zone, then I make it happen
Young kid with a knack for rapping
I put it down
For the team that's sesh Green in between my keys, black heart in my chest
I'm a young man with no remarks for women
Tell them if they got a plan pack your bags run with it
I gotta let you know something about me
I scream fuck the world loud with my jeans to my feet
I sag my pants and flip my cap backwards
Feeling like kid rock rocking like Fred Durst
I am the trouble maker you've been waiting for
My plan is bringing down all these non-originals
So, go dim the lights down draw the curtains down
Let them know we working now
I'ma gut another blunt and blast another beat
And proceed to be the rapper I wanna be
Used to rap sweet sixteens when I was sixteen
Now I rap swisher sweets on beats for free
See, I ain't made a penny yet, let alone a living
So I'm living at my brother's and my parents' on the weekends
Bless their souls, see they know what's coming
A couple mixtapes away from crowds chanting and jumping
I can see it now Th@ Kid surfing crowds
Cowabunga at the top my lungs, look at me now
It's the young teenage mutant ninja turtle
In the sewer with your women, got them moaning like Myrtle
Wait, wait
Let it soak for a second, I'm seventeen rapping like an old hiphop legend
Uh, autobot, transform to the illest
All this buzz got me lifted killing all the statistics
Dropped out moved away started rapping
Now it's to move to the top, faster than all these graduates
I'm hazardous contaminated catheters
With battery acid for every priest and every cathedral
I fucking hate religion bad enough to make a laugh of it
I spot a lower case T on your chain, you must be out of it
Flow like alchemist, elemental power shit
Shape shifted to a throne just to watch them bow to me
I am the overseer, that mean you can't take a corner without me knowing
Yo, so
Go dim the lights down, draw the curtains
Let them know we working now
I'ma gut another blunt then blast another beat
And proceed to be the rapper I wanna be
Yeah
#
What's up dude
Uh
That's whats up dude
I'm coming in rawer than ever (Raw man)
All the top heads of the hip hop game better move out of the way (Look out)
I'm coming for you OJ da Juiceman

I think I rapped on this when I was 10 years old
Man damn time flies when you cryogenic cold
You sport the ice creams with cones on the [?] then I started rocking hoodies with the ape logo, man
And that was back in 7th grade, all the kids sayin' that shits evolved away?
Moon man on the tag diamond dollar on the sleeve, where'd you get that Elmo, man just let me Selling CDs outta my locker at 13
MP3s scheming how to get to my dreams, cuz
I been having many so, many a I can't fall back asleep, can't do another thing till I
Make that motherfuck a reality, spike strip mentality, strike it until you proud of me
Frozen for a minute, now I'm cave man stupid
Back to ruining plans of those who said I couldn't, do it

That's right man, do it
I giggity get it, you know what I'm sayin' dude?
But, um, like I was saying earlier, OJ da Juiceman you're pretty much like, knocked off that rap totem pole after this one dude
Back to the bottom you go Juiceman, with those fuckin' fat man jeans
This is an official diss by the way
#
Yeah
Uh
Look
I kick raps non of that choreographed actin'
My shit slaps, I ain't talkin' limp hand smackin'
I'm closed fist thrashing, catch a hit faster
The [?] Peer Pressure bout Snoop Dogg and crackin'
Feelin good now, big shot ain't ya
Gotcha big boy pants on tryna get famous
But there's just one thing to understand, I stand over you land lovers understand where you stand
You below me, smilin' down on you, laughin' at the distance sound of the raps of fuckin' phonies
When I say, "hold please" you know they be holding
And when I say, "I'm zoning" I'm in another zone, see
The twilight's alright for a zombie, but I got more brains, I don't follow I lead, I got everything I need, this life I see
When I open my eyelids, It's eye popping
Just little old me in some big ol' jeans
Rapping in the mirror while I'm brushin' my teeth
Just 7 years old, with my nice CD's, screamin' "Shoot em up what, shoot em up now bleed"
L-O-V-E for B-E-T-V
I'd wake up early to see the screen
See the countdowns, videos, and hip hop kings, rapping on the [?] with they own gold rings
Like, "how do I get there dad, how do they do it"
"Start rapping young man but if you do you gotta DO IT"
My flows stupid been coming up with new shit
But, hey someone's gotta do this
(It's too good for a hook, I couldn't do that shit...)
#
I'm in motion, young so yoga
Th@ Kid kicking raps, y'all kicking it on the sofa
Man, please just stop the debating
I've been rapping since who knows and been seen vacations
See the days that I played sick to get off school
I was locked inside my room, letting my box boom
Go boom, little box, go spin my rap tunes
Let me jot down the lyrics and rap 'em like rappers do
He's a, young scholar but the troubles still inside of him
Said all the teachers at the meeting and then I started hollering
Fuck every principal, I know you hear me
Said it wouldn't work out for Th@ Kid, now you see me
You read me? Tell me if I ain't coming clearly
I'll gladly fly back home to make sure you hear me
I'm the, troubled young man, dropped out from Howell High
But the same old jumper that you know is how high

I'm in motion, fuck you David, no pants on me, that's what I feel like, I'm wearing shorts but I got no pants on my mind
Spin them funky old raps! Now, rip!
I'm just gonna keep going so you have to hold it there
Not saying anything, nah I'm just kidding
#
Uh
I'm radical to the maximum
Smokin' all these rappers and ashin' on all the rest of 'em
Hope I got the best of 'em, they hopin' it's the last of me, but back again I go unloading what was left in me
Uh
I let this dirty beat get to me
Now I'm fuckin' filthy as fuck and you can't stand near me
They can't stand me, let alone jam me, and every fuckin' speaker to the transistor's jammed, see
The raps that banter funny like bad stand up
When tomatoes hit the stage, you hang it up
So bring out the cartoon broom and sweep me, under the mat like three keys, one key chain, one key to your house, and 2 backup for whenever you locked out, see

My rhymes radical you know you gotta grab a few
Yeah
Uh
My rhymes radical you know you gotta grab a few
Nowww... (Check it out, check it out)
#
I found you at a low place
I made it my dream to take you higher
I found you with a new face
I made it my plan to be your newest, so it's
Geronimo at the top of my lungs
Until I sink into your arms and get saved by your love, I'm screamin'
Geronimo
Geronimo look out below
(Geronimo look out below)

She look me in my eye
And I still can't explain, just what it did to me, but I most certainly changed, and now it's
Impossible, I surrendered my heart
Self destructing for her love, I should've known from the start, and now it's
Geronimo at the top of the hill
There's no other way to show how just how elated I feel, I'm screamin'
Geronimo
Yeah
Geronimo, look out below
#
Find me dashin' till the day time passes
And night falls
Then it's back to the sewer
For the rat, "Au revoir"
I'mma "Bon appetit" this beats
Like Oh Boyy
Better stick around for the main course
I'm back again, the Michigan kid with no respect
Dropped out at sixteen
Then he called collect
Like "Hello fame are you there?
'Cause I'm commin'"
Started drummin' to the beat of his own drum
Brrram-pampam-bumpin' !
Hipster tunes from Indie artists
Dallas Green, Luke Pickett, Manchester Orchestra
Young kid instrumental as orchestras
[?] to transform these raps into accordions
Hold 'em and fold 'em
Smish 'em and cash 'em
That's cash back motherfuck a flashback's flashin'
I'm sorry I had to get that out of the way
Too many best friends I let to not be callin' today

//

Old dutch town
Let me think about it now
Old dutch town
Writtin' thoughts out
Old dutch town
You let me think out loud
Brushed up so many times
That I'm painted up and down
Old dutch town
You let me live in the clouds
I get so high
And I ain't never comin'
Whole dutch town
I can't believe it's allowed
This world's so wrong
I don't wanna leave this town
Whole dutch town
Let me think about it now
Let me write my thoughts out
I ain't never comin' down
#
Rats

In the backseat, windows up
Volume high, dope rolled up
Just another rap song about smoking
But I ain't even begun, watch yo tongue
'Member when you were young
Backwards hats, were they really that dumb?
Fuck yo life with a middle and a thumb
Backseat smoking 'cause I'm young
I be riding, backroads, backseat, smoking
Seats flat back with the sun roof open
Down that back road round the corner
Go park your car and turn it louder
Windows up, already cloudy
Kids so rowdy, young Pat Riley


Always spark the tree, when I'm with the team
Dress scholarly, when a woman in need
Defeat the villain, save the day
Then drop her off safe then she'll come, clean
I'm a hero now, back to the backseat turn the system loud
Put the windows up, go roll one up
Just a typical rap about typical rap stuff
I be riding, backroads, backseat, smoking
Seats flat back with the sun roof open

Backseat smoking (Yeah, with the fucking rats, no [?], fuck you)
#
Yeah

I left home 'most a year ago, friends haven't called me since
They all knew I had to get out, but that's just common sense
So I don't blame 'em if they think that I ran
'Cause I was really running too, I always told 'em my plan
Kiss the coast, and kick Michigan goodbye
'Cause how I see it, that's a place where you live and you die
And I got other plans, I got other fish to fry
Like waking up on the beach, to wipe the ocean out my eye
I'm zoning, young kid want it
And if you say you 'bout it, you better be up on it
'Cause I ain't got no time in mind to spend on spare change
For old friends man, you locked yourself in that cage
Gave you the key once to get out but you just dismissed it
I ain't saying I'm your ticket but if I was you missed it
I ain't putting nothing on you, that's the double truth proof
I just want you to know, that I'ma do it for you
Yeah

This sound like the coldest Midwestern night
Back roads, ice cold, look out for the pol ice
They ain't even po lite, especially when its us
Couple troublemaking teens, booking us for being us
But, we stayed below the radar for the most part
A bar in the garage, see we were far from smart
And the young reckless attitude was long past due
So we did what we had to do, who? Me and my dude crew
The flashbacks hitting me, harder than ever
I feel the frostbite in my hands, the coldest of winters
I'm set the get out of dark, to be the coldest of winners
Now I did, now its time to get on your jackets
Because the paparazzi flashing will be hard to handle
If your eyes ain't used to the spotlight already
But I think I'm ready, and theres no questioning that
I think the real question lies why you ain't a night rat yet

The stupidest fucking line at the end of the song
Fuck
#
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground

And I ain't gotta say nothing
We listening to Marvin, she knows where this is going
And, I don't got a problem taking it there
She hits the blunt in my hand, love is in the air
I'm on my Macbook, going through more beats to rap on
She rubbing my back and ask for something to snack on
I say, "Well theres some gelato around the corner"
Take a Rover to the bikes, hop on, lets ride over there
Sorry I don't got whips like all these rappers do
She looked at me and laughed and said "I don't expect you to"
See kid theres only one thing I need
That's for you to be the same no matter what life brings
And I think that I could keep that promise
'Cause the way my road's looking, traffic's my last problem
So, I'ma be there soon, blow the balloons
Get the confetti ready to throw, blast some tunes
Celebration, celebration, celebration, celebration

Yeah, yeah
#
And she the main attraction
And her being a magnet, I'm easily attracted
And now her face got me easily distracted
Eyes wandering off, they in need of relaxing

She could take a kid to paradise with that kid of smile
And even if she frown, she know I'ma stick around
(And even if she frown, she know I'ma stick around)
I said whatever you need, just call me
We on the same team, rain snow or sleet, hey
We on the same team, we on the same team, rain snow or sleet

She got them elevator eyes, they open up, I rise
On the ride of my life, passing by vital signs
Speeding it 'till she mine in the race against time
Had to rewrite my lines, doubted my last rhyme
This might be my last shot, might as well make it hit
Can't kick raps no more, I gotta make hits
Nevermind nevermind, I stay forever in debt to this
Rap music, trash music, however I reckon it
I'ma get through to you, someday somehow
Maybe not throught these raps but someway, somehow
I'ma do it, and when I do you gonna know it
I'm Th@ Kid, I'm suprised no one's told ya

She could take a kid to paradise with that kid of smile
And even if she frown, she know I'ma stick around
(And even if she frown, she know I'ma stick around)
I said whatever you need, just call me
We on the same team, rain snow or sleet, hey
We on the same team, we on the same team, rain snow or sleet

Yeah, yeah, rats
This shit sounds poppy, but its fucking not so, fuck you
Yeah

Step aside and let a fucking rat do this
At least I got a clue man your raps are clueless
A nuisance since birth, that was my doctor's two cents
So now its time to pay his ass back, old revenge
Oh revenge, how sweet you taste
Roll you up in a wrap, let me blow you away
That's that TeamSESH jargon, who the fuck you arguin'
On beats I'm jogging, you screaming like Tarzan
Turn that shit down, we don't need all that
The kids need someone to look up to, fall back
And let the king rat ride with the pack
You'd have to break your fucking neck back to see where I'm at
I'm rapping over your head, I'm under your bed
I'm a fucking little terror, I'm a fucking little terror

How's it feel to get outshined by your little brother?
Kinda talk get your mouth sewn shut by my mother
See my dad was the man way before I
Up late tryna get his son rockabye bye
Little bo peep, lose no sleep
I'm contridicting myself, this weed's bad for my health
Fuck it, on a mission, to see shit, the man, I be this
This mean I missed, what I become
See I used to be cool, to tell you that all one
I'm all one, the next one, the thing coming up
Channel my inner emo, I just wanna cut
Put your phone down, and lets cease the calls
Sleeping with sirens so ring the alarm, hit the lights
Turn up the amaroso, shining the heat
I'm the brave little toaster, uh
Bring it back, bring it back
#
Hmm, welcome back, this is DJ Don Nuts
Here with my buddy, Baby Jodie
Say hello Baby Jodie
Aha, hello
Alright then, right now you're listening to dreamcatcher
Let it catch your dreams and let it catch your falls
Put this on, lean back and realise my life's better than your's
Have a great night, from all of us here at, Jodie Brothers Inc
Thank you very much, dream catcher
#
I got slacker money, no class money
I want rapper money, I mean cash money
I want Baby and Slim to put out a cash on me and let me bank on the fact that all these rappers phonies
Damn, another song about realness
Like where did hip-hop go, like where is the real shit?
I swear sometimes I want to aim and just kill shit
But what's a good rap without the laid back, trill shit?
Yeah, and metaphors 'bout angles
And how I see rap like no rapper in the game does
Money never change so the money's got to change us
But I just want to be the change and pace the change up
So be patient, don't go changing and chasing waterfalls for the sake of making it rain when you hate it when it rain there
Now you in the club playin' god bring it downpours down on the dancefloor
You see your whole two change left the billboards
Starting using your face in vain just to see more
Hip and [?], thought nothing could go wrong
When money was at your door like "Honey, I am home"
You thought you wanted dreams money could buy
But you just wanted all your beats to be forty supply
[?] deflects over you and be part of the ride
Instead you hopped in shotgun and let your label drive, that's right
#
Sesh raps and old flows
Makes me want to snap on back to them old clothes like old folks
Snap back to the cold world [?] the wind through your hair
And call it your old girl like I ain't bein' home in a minute you see the ride got dark and the windows is tinted, but, sooner or later I knew I had to get out
Threw myself out the car and rolled on out and felt the 
Yeah
I felt the wind blow through my hair
Couldn't believe right there, hanging in the air
Was the reason, the reason to it all
#
See my flow is nasty, ya'lls is so polished
Your whole sound's bullshit and mine's just honest
I dropped out with plans, ya'll planned for college
It's almost been a year and you still haven't got shit
Be honest, you already lost us
Remember all the times that I told you "I got this?"
Well, how can I put this kindly?
In your face, mother fucker, I told you "don't try me"
Now, I got all these songs in the chamber
And go aim, click clack, erase ya
Send you back to another dimension
My raps is in your vision
My verses is in your kitchen
Waiting to be dissected and cooked for more revision

I'm the main ingredient
#
Home all alone
Parents both gone
Money on the table
Use it how you want
Friday night
Ain't nobody home
So we all know you gonna do what you want
But before the celebration
Need some relaxation
So, turn this up a little
Put your feet up
Dim the lights down and chill
#
Uh, I need some closure now
My past is too loud
And there's no telling [?] to turn it down
Feet to the ground, paper to the pen, made their finger to the air, all eyes on the kid
Usually, I'm used to bitches going cookoo
[?] now I'm ain't see how that shit was useful
Crown from the mixtapes, king of the new school
Laughing at the peasants playing loose like a loose tooth
Young man gotta get that tight
And if you want to rule the game you gotta play that right
If you want to be tomorrow, gotta be tonight
But for now, take a sit and watch the kid light mics

Look
Too many [?] saying I saved hip hop
But not enough screaming "I love hip hop"
You gotta feel the kid rock
You gotta hear the kid talk
Feeling new to the game, I ain't even gotta save yet
I know there's a save check from now too famous
Strobe lights, we in sports cars
Peering into dreams that [?] instead of yours, so
I'm doing what I got to do to get 'em
Until I'm [?] [?] [?] into your city
I'mm be the kid, and, you can be the petty telling them go get their shine box they so [?]
#
Light skin
Dark thoughts
Young cocktail, blowing up, Molotov
Mazel tov, congratulations
Round of applause
You have now made it
Gold chain, silver rings and platinum records
At the top, sleeping on ya'll bum bettin'
With [?] rhymes, give a fuck if you get it
But if you want bars, I can serve a life sentence
No question, therefore, I'm never askin'
"Who can keep up with the kid?" In this rap shit
You say you got better flow, I get it, keep going, Nancy
They all just pop, so all I'm seein' is soda cans
But I don't shake 'em
I don't touch 'em, I keep it movin'
White kid too much, so, I keeps it So nowadays everybody loves a rapper, but, only if you get love back from the game, so ya'll some bachelors
#
Too many places
Too many faces
Too many names to forget, just face it
Sometimes we all just need some time on our own to think
And I think my time is now
Cuz I can feel it in my bones
Today I started to grow
Apart from friends that I don't know

Somebody get me out of here
And take me to a place where noone knows my name
I need to be alone for now
I need to be alone for now

Is it this air that turns me cold?
This time of year I feel alone
The wind blows and dries my skin
These people keep to themselves
All living in their own hell
I need to get out of the place I'm in

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night

See outside but you can't see in
My words don't penetrate the skin
Nothing will ever seem to get through
Walk past your problems and your fears
The ones you love are left in tears
Nothing will ever seem to phase you

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night

I can't let go, I'll break, I'll fold
It's got to be this air that's killing me
I know alone is all I've known
And it's old and I'm cold, yeah, but it doesn't phase me

Take me to a place where I don't know anybody
Leave me alone for now
I've grown sick of every face that I've known
This keeps me up at night
#
Well, it's came to an end
Fucking finally
That was dreamcatcher
And I'm DJ Downuts
And this is Lil' Johnny
Lil' Johnny, say goodbye

Goodbye

That's right
New little diddy I learned on the keys
Been tickling the ivories
But, uh, far belong in some short horn cities
A comedy road to nowhere
Coming soon
Keep SESH
That kid
Fuck yourself
#
I'm wrapping gifts like Christmas Eve
I'm choking off the Christmas tree
Back roads too hard to drive but she ain't
Pack the next, windows rolled I can't see her face
I was flying in my zone, went off
High enough to get on whore's behind me toe
Felt good all day, you can bet the bank
I woke up at nine but wrote my song at eight
Hyped up running just to talk to LA
From the top I could, see my place
Knowing it was me felt a little too real
Wondering if I only got, one more year

It fades, it fades, it fades, it fades
And I swear to God I'm the highest I ever been
But, it fades, it fades

With my mind in the, clouds
I'm, peeking backstage tryna see if she, in the, crowd
Tryna play it cool I ain't texted all day
So she don't come and smile, fa, anyway
Pour a drink, into my pockets
Close my Mac and go straight to the faucet
Water in my hands, throw some on my face
Sipping on something that used to be grapes
Rolling up something that came from a female
Pass to my left when I can't see real well
People get loud, hear my name on the mic
And my boy takes the stage, set the mood for the night
Still smoking, still drinking, still trying not to do my thinking

'Cause, it fades. it fades, it fades, it fades
But, it fades, it fades, it fades

Flashbacks playing in my head like movies
Couldn't even think to me before you even tried to move me
Shooting, get moving, drive by to the heart she was too deep
In a two seat, windows down, that's too real, even for me
I'm good now, it's all behind me, love on my heart name outta my mind
See, you can lose count with all these women
Fuck that, fuck them, act like you winning
But when you cross the finish line, when you win the race
Just know that feeling you feeling will always fade

It fades, it fades, it fades, it fades
And I swear to God I'm the highest I ever been
But, it fades, it fades
#
Boombox tuned in, spitting my shit
Flowing on beats, hear the sound of the ocean
Hear it from the front back to the rafters
Rap for the cam, that's a wrap after action
Wait, who, me? I'm rapping for the passion
Last place rappers see me laugh as I pass them
Ashing on these bastards and passing off they ass
To my young night rats, quick to throw 'em in the trash
'Cause I know one thing you don't
The bottom comes out on top don't you know
And, the bad kid's been grounded for a while
Playing music too loud, fuck 'em, no, turn it up now
This here is my radio jam, radio jam, r-radio jam
This right here is my radio jam, fuck anybody staring
Blare it loud as you can, radio jam, radio jam
Radio jam, r-radio jam, this right here is my radio jam
Fuck anybody staring, blare it loud as you can

This right here is my radio jam
Fuck anybody staring, blare it loud as you can

Night, rats, rat, pack

Giving all you white kids something to feel hard to
Giving all you fine bitches something to get off to
Cunt get off me, I ain't into fucking for money
But I can see that you is, so how much cash you got on yuh?
We can make it rain, like in the videos
Or I'll just snap ya jawbone, take your dough and hit the road
Or maybe we can get to rolling like the fucking Stones
Mick jacking swagger from rappers that died in '94
Thick gold chains, big O rings
Fake diamonds turning green like my mood change
Green light in my head help me do thangs
Speeding to the life like a bitch I'ma soon bang
Bang bang, open up
If life's a bitch, consider her fucked
Because, this game's giving me blue balls
So I'ma fuck the world to keep it moving like U-Hauls
Night rats, rat pack
Running shit soon, word to the running back
Oh that's me, how could I forget
Lord of the rats, duke of the depths
(Bitch!)
Yeah, fuck [?], fuck Jeff [?], yeah
#

Lord of the rats, back-back from the gutter
Slingshot and cold feet, mo'fuckers right in the summer
I just do me, and a parade of bitches follow you
Like "Who he?", McConaughey motherfucker so just do it
And don't be taken back, roll the window in your mind down
Let my raps draft, see y'all are just a breath
Of fucking fresh air, while I stay cologne commercial
Dirty fingers through my hair 'cause I'm
Matthew McConaughey, Matthew McConaughey
Matthew McConaughey
"Matthew uh, Matthew McConaughey
I, I'm just like Matthew McConaughey if you think about it"

Fuck you, fuck you
#
Fuck, night, rats

I was a kid on the bus, throwing food at the driver
Screaming at rail roads when told to be quiet
I never hesistated to give any fucks
To any of these mo'fuckers thinking I rap for funds
Some say, in a way, I was raised by the sun
Instead of going the church on Sundays, like some
I'd stay home and sketch out gold chains and guns
And big stacks of one's and big bulky blunts
Dreams of diamonds and gold fronts
And a couple bad bitches with some fat ol' butts
So now I'm flicking blunt ashes on the devil as I stunt
Like Knievel to the Evel life that I truly want
They told me rap wouldn't get me far
But now I'm looking back laughing 'cause I'm out with the stars
Hella far, hella far, whatchu think bitch? I'm hella far
Out right, rat pack bitch

Strictly for
Mike Coppola all up in that ass
#
Aye

I Haven't seen you in a while
Hows everything doing
Do you still act wild?
Long school nights
Out party till the lights out
Girl you haven't changed, I prayed you would by now
Cause rumours Finally out, I was tryna father ya
Cause boys they always bother ya, and men they always howl at ya
I was tryna pull you up outta hell before it killed ya
Now it seems you down with the devil
And I told ya so
No way, can I go further down this road you told me to follow
I roll with the sorrow, had some pain to swallow
It had me wishing I could wake it, take it to tomorrow
The morning after cause you ain't living for that
You keep living for the drinks, started dying at the thought of that
And all I ever truly wanted was the truth, and I'm glad that you know
The one that can't speak, its you
Aye

Choice, You gotta make em
Choice, Yeah, You gotta make the right one
Choice, You gotta make em. But I ain't the one, so consider me gone

Choice, You gotta make em
Choice, Yeah, You gotta make the right one
Choice, You gotta make em. But I ain't the one, so consider me gone

Are you recording? Huh? Alright
Hey music listeners, its Andrew here, hoped you tuned in for a great one, well I know you did 'cause I already heard it, ha, jokes
(Nice one lame-o)
Well, alright, no its Andrew, this is a mixtape by Andrew, not fucking J.Bones, roll it
(DJ fucking J.Bones in the mix)
Just fucking roll it
#
No c'mon man I'm really happy to see you
(Alright)
You stupid fuck

I'm just a dope ass kid with card collection
Too much time on my hands to be stressing, I'm stretching
The limits of the kid, finding new flaws
Higher than all, I feel the rain before it falls
But when it comes time, and rain comes down
I ball on every drop, y'all sitting in the crowd
Fame on my brain 'cause my name's what I'm 'bout
T-H-@ sign K-I-D wear it out
Put it on and wear it out, tell ya friends
And let 'em know Th@ Kid's on the block again
They call me bully by the way I'm always teasing
And sometimes I don't know what y'all see in me
Then again, I'm a blueprint to success
Follow my steps, I'll do the rest
But don't get to the top and play best 'cause
Who you kidding Jack we all know who you piggybacked

Ayy did we get that box of CD's yet? Anybody seen those?
(I'm-I'm here about the boxes, you see about the boxes coming in next Thursday?)
Yeah, the CD's
(I'm here to tell you its gonna be Friday, sorry to tell you about that)
Fucking ayy
(Yeah shipments just gonna be pushed back a day, but uh yeah [?])
What the fuck did Charlie tell you? Thursday?
(No no, Charlie didn't, no, he told me about the boxes he just said you need to think outside the box)
No he fucking didn't, oh my fucking God
(But you still need the box, y'know, 123, 12 box, 34 box, 578 box)
I don't have the time for this shit
(He can tell you what you like really)
Shut the fuck up
(It ain't nothing to me, me and my mate Raj, we just love to box)
Who the fuck is? Uh, the boxes, the CD's, aren't gonna come in 'till fucking, just play the next song
#
I think junior high's when everything started changing
Started drawing curtains, turned into a caveman
A brain dead teenager that brain fed
Off attention from any girl he heard gave head
Became well known but they all knew my plans
Have 'em over after school, I'd fuck 'em and then jet
The asshole boyfriend strikes again
Opted out as the kid you never trust again
And take you, trust ya friends and they all fall for me
Just a pawn in my game like you said, but I'm all for it
I bring 'em all down to the basement to drown
At the bottom of the bottle where the message is found
And no breath, somebody please control me
I'm just a stupid cunt girl too drunk for my own knees
Just look at the way they folding, buckle to the floor
Oh we got more vodka? I ain't drunk no more
The problem with hormones when the doors close
Added with a couple drinks just subtracts the clothes
But, I don't see a problem with that equation
Why you think I had you over? For some good conversation?
"Don't tell your friends, I'm not a whore"
I'm sure you aren't honey go ahead now lock the door

The south fool, change my style change the weather
The south fool, change your mind just too clever
The south fool, all the weak styles I sever
Combining two styles on the mic with master killer
I'm sure you aren't honey go ahead now lock the door
The south fool, change my style change the weather
The south fool, change your mind just too clever
The south fool, all the weak styles I sever
Combining two styles on the mic with master killer

Bitch got a black eye and Stifler got six stitches
('Cause you fucking beat me!)
Touch me I fight

Look, its time move something I onto my next victim
When I see her symptoms, cannibalism in form of some rat music
Take away your track then abuse it, amusement
Hits my face then down to my palms
I picked up the pen then I started a war
I wrote out a couple letters to throw out to fellas
Tell 'em if they ain't thinking 'bout running, they better
I sank my teeth in the neck of the game
Assassinating any prey that thinking they big game
I Son of Sam things when I stow them in the attic
Ain't nobody else can have it

Simplistically gifted, they was close but they missed it
I change a four to a dollar sign, no shifting
Oven on my spitter turn dough into a biscuit
Now I'm here to fuck up beats that rewind and skip the dipshit
(I'm here about the boxes, is Charles here?)
We're recording
Fucking right I'm a misfit
Times in the hoodie you can stay on your rich shit
I never wished it, I just get lifted and listen

Aww, yeah, no
#
Ya ok, uh, Graveyard Music, fucking, what's the other one? Kid something, huh, is it recording? Are we recording?
(Ya)
Oh, hey its Andrew, that was Graveyard Music, sending you off to your next hit, sounded like Casey Cason, look a little better, cock's a little bigger though
And we're bringing it onto the fucking, goddamn it dude I'm so bad at this
(Big Kid Lingo)
Big Kid Lingo!
(Taking you off, DJ fucking J.Bones!)
#
Jim, let me handle this, these are my people
(They're gay?)
No, you bleeding imbecile, they have style, they're cultured, they're sophisticated
(So they're gay?)

Its Th@ Kid
Uh, yeah yuh

I'm a big kid now, got ten bags worth of blow
In the game, putting time in 'till its time out
Uh, ball 'till I ball out
Gone like a dove, spark when its dark
Me, I'm the kid with the no worries attitude
Hakuna Matata for anyone with gratitude
Go take your time, make sure that your hearing me
'Cause I'ma be here 'till everybody feelin' me
Rain rain come again another day
What they all say when the kid wanna play
'Cause when I told them trouble is my middle name
Mean no troublemaking everybody in the game say
Everybody in the game fame ask if I play
And I take you to the same place
Still a kid doing all the kid things
Snapback, flipback gotta snap into my game face
Gotta get up, get up
Get out, get out
Take it to take it, don't make it to make it
Otherwise see your life go cold and vacant
Get up, get up
Get out, get out
Don't fake it to make it, otherwise you'll be taken
To a whole other life that consists of the fake shit

Th@ Kid

Now a days rap music's a metaphor in a beat
Just dumbed down for dumb crowds to get what they mean
And all the sudden i'm getting all these pats on the back
From the same kids who used to hate when i say that i like rap
Like "hey i like it too now, you heard of wiz khalifa? curren$y? Mac Miller? Black and Yellow's my favorite"
It's just the same bullshit every time that i hear it
Thinkin' they so underground when they don't fuckin know the meaning
Just cause you went home and did some research on em
Downloaded the discography you think you been on em
But you fuckin been off em
And i know that thats a fact
Get to laughing every time you faggots say you like rap
What happened to baller blockin and throwin shots at artists when they slip up and use your name in their recordin'
What you know about wayne fool? he went and fuckin made it
Did you have dedication when he dropped dedication?
See, the problem with today, better yet with rap
You can go home and log on and download the pack
But still, you'll never know what it's like to be a fan
Signin off, the rap fanatic, establishin' 97'
#
Look, rats pyromaniac, back from the fifth century
Shooting medieval arrows setting fire to my enemies
So if you stepping you better be fucking armored
I don't feel like being charged for murder with no lawyer
I'd rather be fucking chartered to islands outside the border
With service to take pictures and message the Mr boarders
Like I wish you were here and I wish you never doubted me
Always done at the office, we're getting rowdy see
"I don't understand why gotta be so out of it
You high young man?" No well, possibly
Screaming never worked to try and get a rise out of me
But he did it anyways like he took the bad out of me
But you can't take bad out Th@ Kid, its like a battery kit
Fucking bat out the cave, see it just won't happen
My teachers gave it up, used to say I'm washed up
So its time to hang it up
Opted out the cap and gown graduation scene
Gradually moved on to work a full time dream
See, all the gears were in motion, some smoking
Just some friction from the haters that will not stop hoafing
But anyways, here I am, as I stand
A free form rapper with potential in hands so
Jump on before the train's fucking gone
Th@ Kid's be the [?] Ferrari stamp on the boxcar

Boxcar, Ferrari stamp on the boxcar, boxcar
Fucking fight me then
I think you should be ok, but um
#
As the sun creeps through the blinds
Don't be scared, my arms are around you
You'll be just fine
The troubles that await at home for you
Ain't going nowhere
So why not stay a little longer?
'Cause they ain't gonna run from you
They ain't gonn' run from you
#
I'm Th@ Kid, you might not'a heard'a me yet
And see respect is some' that I don't expect just yet
I know it takes time, a little convincing
A little background check from Th@ Kid and why he's spitting
But first let me get one thing out the way
I don't live a gutter life, I don't see a lot of rain
I only see rays at the beach all day
Catching tans while your town catch a second ice age
Th@ Kid, you already know the name
Welcome to my playground, let me show you how we play
We take our dreams, map 'em out then drive hot
Wheel to the doorstep, step inside
Pick apart my bars, correct all my flaws
And say I ain't hood when I never said I was
Some say hate's just the cousin of envy
But if it is, I don't wanna meet the rest of the family
I'm just tryna do me, then again who can blame me
If you ever see me, you'll be doing the same thing
Haters gonn' hate, lovers gonn' love
But after I'm done they all gonna say wassup to the
Kid

Say wassup
Say wassup
Say wassup
Uh
#
(Yep)
You recording?
(Yes) Alright
Hey guys its Andrew here, just putting another song on for ya here's the next one
#
Well, polish my nuts and serve me a milkshake

I've been one with my songs since the motherfucking start
Rip the beat out the timeline, put it in my heart
Little kid, living large, just the youngest in charge
When it comes to driving dreams I got the keys to the car, uh
One more hit 'till I'm going going gone
Keep, Amazon bars keep 'em flowing flowing on
Call me young Frankenstein, its alive its alive
Breath into the verse, give it life give it life
The kid taking over one level at a time
Knocking off every boss 'till the game's all mine
I'm a young half pint on my way to a leader
Double dare, 2011, and I dare it like Jeter
Took all the chances, rolled all the dice
Now I'm winning every night, put your queens in a vice
Took a picture with your wife, make her Facebook famous
Next up, verses giving hip hop a facelift

Oh my God, sir
I think you just killed it
(Yeah, what about it? Hahaha, have a drink kid)
#
Hahaha, yeah, yeah

I said its all on me, rain sleet or snow
Buzzing at yo door, I'm here to deliver flows
Addressing like you relevant when you ain't even close
So old news like last week's post
Sorry, I'm just known to keep it realer than most
Y'all must not have heard, must have not got the memo
My friends call me Elmo, my fans call me Kid
Since you choose to be neither bitch you can call me this
The only fucking reason you know what designer is
BBC, Ice Cream, do you know what that is?
Didn't back then, but did after I showed up
Bum ass clothes, I wear 'em and then they blow up
My hands up, throwing caution to the breeze
Now they all feeling me, mission complete

I said its all on me, rain sleet or snow
Buzzing at yo door, I'm here to deliver flows
This that mailman flow, this that mailman flow
I'm here to deliver flows

Yeah, uh
I mean, I think we should be ok
Vrrm vrmm
#
Uh, yeah, look

See, I am what it means to be too cool for school
Dropped out, sky high, I was raised by the wolves
We howl at the moon, kick raps make tunes
'Cause we do what girls like and they like what we do
See, mama always told me. "Sonny keep it moving"
And money always kept my, little legs moving
Running to the life that I seen in the movies
No script, no shifts gonna tell me how to do me
But those camera phones sure gonn' shoot me
You see 2D, I see three
Dreams come to life, Herbie coupe seats
Rude girls, push the button tell the rude to leave

Let it breathe, let it breathe, triple bypass on the beat
Now let it be, let it be, let it be, triple bypass on thing, see

I'm just a good burger kid, mind dope burger flow
We can magnify the beef if you really tryna grow
Get your protein in, buy it right, from the sto'
But you can't buy raw, 'cause me, that all I are
All I is, all I ams, just the way, that I'm playing
With these anti gamers that don't know how to play it
When I turn it to the flame and light the fucking stage
Then I start up tommorow just to light it up again

Let it breathe, let it breathe, triple bypass on the beat
Now let it be, let it be, let it be, triple bypass on thing, see

Yeah
It's a lil' real estate person
It figures mom and dad get the house

Roll and smoke something 'fore you listen to this
60 straight bars about snacks, take a hit of this
My remarks are sweet talks, suprises at the end
Slim Jim living yo, I crack before I bend
Snap into this before you catch any ill feelings
Head on the pillow, brain falling like theres no ceiling
Swiss cake rolling on 'em, they don't wanna
Cup of nice chilli in hand, I run up on her
Kill 'em with the young unsolved Black Dahlia
When I burn weed I laugh, they call it salvia
Screw-top booze I make them flip their wig
Silly little rabbit they say Trix is for kids
Fresh out the oven, shovin' cheese in my pockets
Got money, hot money, hot pockets
Snack dealer, I move birds I shed weight
Infomercial, Kit-Kat I take a break

Hey guys uh, my name's Rick Morecannabis (Hi Rick)
I'm covering Sesh lungs addict
But now I'm back to show you motherfuckers what's going on (What)

I'm all that and a bag of Doritos
Pulling up to the drive thru window
Two double cheese then we cool like the heat low
Look at the time gotta run, Cheerio
Cereal with the milk to the top though
Spill it, playing Vice City riding from the cops
Grand Theft Auto, PS2
DVD Goofy movie Hi-def soon
Greek salad with the croutons heavy
With the feta, green leaves with all of the proper dressings
Black tavern, straight lace
Sperry topsider still wet from the boat race
Money on my mind, hand in my pocket
Shrimp from the Bay with a drink from the Tropics
Real talks only words that I say
Half court, shot of gin, thats how you Tanqueray

Pocket full of change, more in my backpack
Five dollars now, what can I get for that?
Snacks, I want all these snacks
Gotta get the snacks, gotta get the snacks
Pocket full of change, more in my backpack
Five dollars now, what can I get for that?
Snacks, I want all these snacks
Gotta get the snacks, gotta get the snacks

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta get the snacks
Alright thank you guys I, I feel a lot better
(No problem Rick)
Alright
(Hahahaha)

You already know what it is
DJ J.Bones motherfuckers
Its time to drink up
Yeah

I might fly and lose it all
I'll be a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, oh
Maybe you'll walk away
Set me up and light me off
I'll be a cannonball
But maybe I'll walk away, oh
But maybe I'll away
Cannonball
I'll be a cannonball
Cannonball
Cannonball
I'll be a cannonball
Cannonball

They say to live life fast so I'm quick with the shots
Pouring another one up, fill it up to the top 'cause
All my problems seem to fade away, when I take another shot to head, to the head
Whatevers left homie, promise I'ma finish that
Rhyme Bay goggles on baby no strings attached
We can do whatever you want girl
And we don't gotta tell nobody what we did, what we did
You went shot for shot now you looking like a star again
Took another hit, and I'm somewhere out in Romulan
Spacebound with a bottle of gin
Wearing nothing but a smile, lipstick on my lips
And my mind's so gone, my legs going numb
Stand up just to fall, so domino drunk but
I'ma find a bad bitch to call my own
And a soft place to fall, see me landing in the sheets like a

Cannonball
I'll be a cannonball
Cannonball
Cannonball
I'll be a cannonball
Cannonball

I got my team back home, cheering for me
Voicemail box full nobody hearing from me
I'm in the game, doing everything I said
If I ain't doing it for me, I'ma do it for my team

On my way to the top now
In a minute to win, no matter what they say
I've gone too far, no turning around now
Uh, yeah you can't get in my way
On my way to the top now
In a minute to win, no matter what they say
I've gone too far, no turning around now
Uh, yeah you can't get in my way

Let me pause for a second, a moment for laughter
Remember ECD, back in December?
'Member, the cold winter snow gonn' hit us
Then its down to the basement, there we make memories
'Member these, good times, better be
In ya top 10 times 'cause they in my top five
Thinking 'bout, every night, every boom Howell fire
Get to sparking the lighter, in my soul and now I'm fire
Now I'm the kid, now I'm the man
I been on my own but never forgot the plan
Get the money in advance, flashback to my head
Powering the little engine that could, and now I can
I break silence, then I make fans
We want dimes bitches so you better bring your finer seat
I just want the diamonds and gold, C3PO
Had to hit 'em with that ECD flow

On my way to the top now
I've gone too far, no turning around now
On my way to the top now
I've gone too far, no turning around now

I'm on my way to the top
I'm on my way to the top
I'm on my way to the top
ECD, we don't stop
I'm on my way to the top
I'm on my way to the top
ECD, we don't stop

Phone's on silent, best friends dialing
Missed calls, pissed off that they missing all this
Driving towards the fame, don't mind the wait
If there's traffic, ok I don't care long it takes
Just as long as I get there, sooner than eventually
Is what the clock keeps telling me when I'm questioning
Hear it in my voice, see it in my eyes
I was made for the fame, I was built for the life
And when my friends go and tell me "Keep it pushing"
I take it to the limit, and then I push it
Further than I've ever gotten before
I'm looking back on the past like where the fuck did you go
Then I snap to reality, future looking bright
Better get your shades on 'fore its out like a light
'Cause people get nervous and they don't let it surface
They know that once it his the air, everybody 'ready heard it
And now they say you don't deserve it
But everything up to this moment was for this purpose
Right, because everybody doubts greatness
In the beginning, so bear with me, give me patience
(In the beginning, so bear with me, give me patience)

This is more than just a beat to me, this is time travel
Bring me back to the gravel of those back roads of Howell
Let me talk, turn the system down
Its 35 outside and all the windows down
You can, feel the breeze, or get lost in it
Run to the flashbacks, hide from the present
Whatever you gonn' choose, its on you
But when you go missing know that I go there too
'Cause the only thing, that meant anything
Ran from me, left me in the pain
I couldn't see the light, I could only feel rain
Coming down on my face, baptised in the name
T-H-@ sign K-I-D
Came to be where my past life wasn't seen
But now its time to make that motherfucker visible
Abracadbra 'till the whole world missing you
'Cause we famous, like I always said
Everything we was wishing became reality check
From the, baggage claims, the layover planes
The seven nights, seven crowds all screaming one name
The joint burns, something like my life
Coming down to the filter, gotta do it tonight
(Gotta do it tonight, uh)
#
Alright you ready?
(Yup)
Women be shopping
Wait, is it on now?
(Yes, it's fucking recording)
Is this like the end though, do I do the end sign off thing?
(Yes)
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, it is the end of the mixtape
Maybe we'll, redo that
(DJ motherfucking J.Bones)
Signing off its uh, DJ, Andrew! Ingram!
And this is Tony Rutsell
(And this is Bob Marshall)
We'll let the crowd take you out
(What a great night for hockey)

It's the lonely girl
In the lonely world
Got every man asking you Please now be my girl
(Be my girl)
(Be my girl)
(Please be my girl)
Hella loaded cherry sucker for some of the finest things
Blinded by the light of the prices on all of the diamond rings;
But, see
No matter what the price
You gone be alone at the end of the night

You gone be alone at the end of the night
You feelin' right
And you don't listen to advice on how to live your life right (life right)
So accustomed to the (fast life)
That you screaming fuck everybody cause this is your night
Pretty hazel eyes, I know she's been staring at me
I could take her home but tommorow she'll forget about me
Wake up (wake up), she gone
A note on the table saying she had fun

It's the lonely girl
In the lonely world
Got every man asking you Please now be my girl
(Be my girl)
(Be my girl)
(Please be my girl)
Hella loaded cherry sucker for some of the finest things
Blinded by the light of the prices on all of the diamond rings;
But, see
No matter what the price
You gone be alone at the end of the night

Hey
I'm Satan's gift to the twenty first century
Shitting in brown bags and lighting them on your porch to see
Exactly how much shit you can take from me
Ding Dong ditching these rappers until they start to plead insanity
The baddest kid on the block
Bullet pop
A bad temper makes me weed and some rock
I got people saying the paying attention to shit
But you gotta stay humble without you mentioning shit
Bitch
I'm on another level
You can't surpass me
My teacher's knew that too, that's why they never passed me
Maybe actually the problem went and practically blew up in my face
When I didn't do my maths sheets
But they did teaching for everyone for everything that they teach us
There was one bad kid ditching class on the bleachers
And that was me
Hello world
Coming live from the place with Hollywood girls
I'm drunk down and tryna holla at your bitch
I told her if she bring a friend, we can all split like
Banana peels, abundant gorilla thugs, you feel me?
Little bitches while I'm Mighty Joe Young
See
I'm fresh out the Styx
While dirt roads back home weren't leading me to shit
So, I said fuck it
I moved away now I wake and live the California Dream everyday
My teachers use to hold me after when I did wrong
And asked me what I wanna do
I'd say rap songs
They got to laughing everytime that I said it
Now I get emails saying that they regret it
#
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, haha

Look, zig zags and Louis tags, the path we tread
Gets scattered footprints and throwbacks to the
Expel blunt smoke from one of my pockets
This got you jumping like a set of hydraulics
In the apartment spitting proper
Just to let y'all know, I'm still the father
To these rap Skywalkers, they see me and see a problem
Honest, nobody ever has the courage to harness
The hardest rapper, see you tripping but ya boys I'ma claim to be the youngest in the game like Bryant
I could do it, with one eye shut, like a pirate
I ain't tryna get my name in life by rapping fabrication
I do it to talk the knowledge, that's a real education
Its the patience in the patient that make it so hard to waiting
The line you call life, when your number's called you gotta take it
People hating on Th@ Kid 'cause I'm the dominant
So they just get to talking shit but do it under anonymous
They doing it under anonymous, while I relax and light my blunt
And vote for the democracy

Yeah, Cousin Eddie

Welcome to my world
Can take a look around
But wipe your feet before you step up inside this house
They say if you've seen one you've seen 'em all
But if you haven't heard of me you ain't heard nothin' at all (No)
I've got people who still hate me
Havin' nightmares of me makin' it
While awakin' to my daydream, so wake up
To everybody who sleepin'
You try to hit the snooze button but it won't stop a beepin'
Oh my, look how time is flyin' I just [? 0:42] with diamonds, I'm in
Another timezone, smokin' that time bomb, that C4 tree
You ain't on what I'm on
(No) I find myself in the studio
Take some kush to the head and now I'm lost boy like Rufio
I let the truth be told, man I don't run from it
I just chase my dreams in a marathon, it's all or nothin'

Work
Work
(I just chase my dreams in a marathon, it's all or nothin')
Work
Work
(I just chase my dreams in a marathon, it's all or nothin')
Work
Work

I got a dude named Vince Vaughn
All he do is break up
I smoke [? 1:26] (I smoke [? 1:28])
All I remember is when I wake up
I got a girl who gets it free (gets it free)
Edible for kush weed
I know a guy in the D
That gives us tree and LSD
You won't believe what you see
Pink line, purple weed
Black sky, white bank
I'm doin' what you said I couldn't, what you think?
I'm super cali, fragilistc
Twist it off Don't believe in matchin', now I'm true
Smoke [? 2:10], while I roll this
Five hundred dollars
For your fuckin' volcano
I dont give a fuck
I roll 
Work [x9]

Look, scrolling through my contact list
I was never one to keep numbers
But I do keep a couple on me
Like I kidnapped two true lovers
My heart set the highest bar for me to jump over
But I know I'ma clear it when it's all over
So for now I'ma practice all my rapping shit
I'm already living where all of them actors is
But don't confuse it, a lot of people get it twisted
This is the closest you'll ever get, so pay attention
I couldn't put my heart anymore into it
If I did, I'd up and turn up into it
I'd turn into rap, I'd turn to a beat
But if I did any of those, I wouldn't be me
(I just wouldn't be me)

Two things on my mind still, but I'm only gonna mention one
Why'd you do it? Was I really not good enough?
I guess my heart was only meant for one
Of course it'd have to happen with my best friend too
Couldn't go behind my back without stabbing it too
Now every second that you cold and alone
Just know you could had have heat and a love of your own
You know when people say "You ain't worth the breath?"
I hope you know that you ain't even worth that
You ain't even worth that, you ain't even worth that
Now it's onto the next one, fuck was I thinking?
When I say this would be the best one, then I got to thinking
There's so much more to be given
Two weeks, keep ya eye on Th@ Kid

Two weeks, another mixtape
Keep ya eye on Th@ Kid
There's so much more to be given
