My voice can fly
it can pass through
any wound
any time
any solitude
without any control from me
my song takes shape
like this is my voice that comes from my heart
 
And it will fly without me wanting it
by the most distant roads
by the the dreams that I dreamed
it will be the reflection of the love of what I had to live
it will be the background music to all that I felt
 
And hear my sound, my old sound
it has the key of any generation
in the soul of my people
in the leather of the drum
in the hands of conguero*
in the feet of the dancer
 
I will live there I'll be
as long as a conbarsa* passes with my rumba I shall sing
I shall be always what I was with my sugar for you
I will live, I will live
 
And now I once more remember that time long ago
when I left searching for the sky of freedom
how many friend I left
and how many tears I cried
and today I will live to find them again
 
And I shall go on with my song
dancing music hot as I dance
and when a huaracha* sounds and when a huahuanco* ssound
in the blood of my people I will be
 
And hear my sound, my old sound
it has the key of any generation
in the soul of my people
in the leather of the drum
in the hands of conguero*
in the feet of the dancer
 
I will live there I'll be
as long as a conbarsa* passes with my rumba I shall sing
I shall be always what I was with my sugar for you
I will live, I will live
 
And hear my sound, my old sound
it has the key of any generation
in the soul of my people
in the leather of the drum
in the hands of conguero*
in the feet of the dancer
 
I will live there I'll be
as long as a conbarsa* passes with my rumba I shall sing
I shall be always what I was with my sugar for you
I will live, I will live
 
Surviving
in this life is what I am doing
surviving
I am surviving, I am surviving
surviving
so that people still hear me
 
Breaking barriers I go surving
Crossing frontiers I go surviving
I thank God for this gift
He gave me this voice and I have given it to you gladly
 
Breaking barriers I go surving
Crossing frontiers I go surviving
for you my people, I shall always sing
I shall give you my sugar, caramba*, and I will survive
 
Breaking barriers I go surving
Crossing frontiers I go surviving
 
I will live, I will live, I will live, and I will survive.
