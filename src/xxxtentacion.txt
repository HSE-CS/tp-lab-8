It will all be over soon
And I'm always where the sun don't shine,
the tears don't show, won't hurt me now 'cause
Heart's been broke, I hate myself, but
It won't show, I constantly lose all
My remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and
Three for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who
Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
Handle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me
All you can offer, now I'm trapped in a changing maze
Setting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace
Where is this going, hey? Heartless is recklessness, it's
Word of a pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm
Off of the map, My Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he
Said he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed
What is this thing?, I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright we gon' be all
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright we gon' be all
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be al-, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, we gon' be al-
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be alright we gon' be all
We gon' be alright we gon' be all
