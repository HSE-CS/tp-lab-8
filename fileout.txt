Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo I don't want 
to be afraid, the deeper that I go 
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric 
souls Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, 
is this taboo? Baby, we built this house 
on memories Take my picture now, shake it 
till you see it And when your fantasies 
become your legacy Promise me a place, in 
your house of memories I think of you 
from time to time more than I thought 
I would You were just too kind and 
I was a fool
